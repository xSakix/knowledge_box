<h2 id="erhard-busek-memorial-lecture-wolfgang-petritsch">Erhard Busek Memorial Lecture: Wolfgang Petritsch</h2>
<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFKtdngwe3o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFKtdngwe3o</a></p>
<h1 id="the-aart-busek-memorial-lecture-navigating-a-world-in-contestation">The Aart Busek Memorial Lecture: Navigating a World in Contestation</h1>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium in 2024 was a significant event, not least because it hosted the third Aart Busek Memorial Lecture. This lecture series, established in honor of the late Aart Busek, a distinguished Austrian diplomat and a key figure in the establishment of the University of Vienna's Center for Advanced Studies, aims to engage with crucial issues shaping the future of Europe and its place in the world. The 2024 lecture, titled "Contestation and the New Dynamics of Global Politics," was delivered by Wang Petric, a senior Austrian diplomat with an illustrious career that spans from being the International High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina to serving as Austria's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva.</p>
<h2 id="aart-busek-a-man-of-many-firsts">Aart Busek: A Man of Many Firsts</h2>
<p>Wang Petric began his lecture by paying tribute to Aart Busek, a man he described as "a mentor, a friend, and someone instrumental in putting together the University of Vienna's Center for Advanced Study." Busek's legacy, he noted, lives on in the Memorial Lecture series, which has seen distinguished speakers like former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou and journalist Misha Glenny take the stage in previous years.</p>
<p>Petric highlighted Busek's many 'firsts' in his career, including his role in the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999, his service as the EU's representative in Kosovo, and his chairmanship of the succession commission tasked with the divorce procedure of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He also noted Busek's tenure as Austria's Permanent Representative to the UN and OECD, and his role as the president of the Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation. Throughout his career, Busek was known for his conflict-free relationships and his ability to maintain mutual understanding and respect with those around him.</p>
<h2 id="a-man-of-many-roles">A Man of Many Roles</h2>
<p>Busek, Petric noted, was a rare breed: a public intellectual, a practical politician, and a practitioner all rolled into one. His intellectual arrogance, while sometimes criticized, was also what drove him to make things happen. He was known for bringing together the Austrian People's Party and the Social Democratic Party in a grand coalition, a move that brought Austria into the European Union. Despite the controversy that surrounded him, Busek's distinct personality was a driving force behind many of Austria's most significant political moves.</p>
<h2 id="the-legacy-of-milan-kundera-and-the-idea-of-middle-europe">The Legacy of Milan Kundera and the Idea of 'Middle Europe'</h2>
<p>Petric also touched on Busek's interest in Milan Kundera's idea of 'Middle Europe,' a concept that Vienna, in particular, has paid close attention to. This idea, first proposed by Kundera in his essay "The Tragedy of Central Europe," suggests that Central and Eastern Europe should not be viewed as a mere buffer zone between East and West, but as a distinct cultural and historical region with its own unique identity. Busek, Petric noted, was one of the few politicians who truly understood and championed this idea.</p>
<h2 id="the-world-in-2024-a-new-era-of-contestation">The World in 2024: A New Era of Contestation</h2>
<p>Turning to the main topic of his lecture, Petric observed that the world in 2024 is a place of intense contestation, driven by a range of factors including Russia's full-scale aggression in Ukraine, the resurgence of violent territorial conflicts worldwide, and the growing rivalry between the United States and China. This new dynamic, he argued, is characterized by a growing coalition of middle powers promoting an anti-Western discourse and challenging the existing global governance structure.</p>
<p>Petric noted that this new era of contestation is also marked by a widening gap between the rich and the poor, both within and between nations. The gap between the super-rich and the poor is growing alarmingly, and this is compounded by the fact that many countries are burdened by unsustainable debt. Meanwhile, identitarian nationalism is on the rise, threatening the very fabric of post-colonial societies. The triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution only serves to exacerbate these issues.</p>
<h2 id="the-european-union-a-global-political-player">The European Union: A Global Political Player</h2>
<p>Despite these challenges, Petric argued that the European Union has the potential to play a significant role in shaping the new global order. He pointed to the EU's recent adoption of the AI Act, a comprehensive set of rules for artificial intelligence, as evidence of its growing regulatory leadership. This, he suggested, is a sign that the EU is ready to accelerate and deepen its integration, even in areas like defense and foreign security policy.</p>
<p>However, Petric also noted that the EU faces significant internal challenges, including the question of sovereignty and the need to reform its financial and tax regime. He suggested that the upcoming elections for the European Parliament and the new commission and council could be crucial in determining the EU's direction over the next five years.</p>
<h2 id="europes-role-in-the-new-multipolar-world">Europe's Role in the New Multipolar World</h2>
<p>Given the new dynamics of global politics, Petric argued that Europe must adopt a new mental map of the world that recognizes the power of non-Western actors and the importance of global justice. He suggested that the EU's neighborhood policy, which has thus far failed to address the double standard between its treatment of Ukraine and Gaza, could be a starting point for this new approach.</p>
<p>Petric ended his lecture on a hopeful note, quoting the philosopher Hannah Arendt to remind the audience that "the unexpected is not something that happens to us, but something we do." He urged the attendees to engage with the challenges facing Europe and the world with a spirit of openness and faith in the future, ready to navigate the uncharted waters ahead.</p>
<h2 id="the-way-forward">The Way Forward</h2>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium in 2024, with its Aart Busek Memorial Lecture, was a testament to the ongoing dialogue and engagement with the future of Europe and its place in the world. As Wang Petric's lecture made clear, the world in 2024 is a place of intense contestation, requiring a new mental map and a new approach from Europe and its partners. The challenges are daunting, but with a spirit of openness and a faith in the future, Europe can play a significant role in shaping the new global order.</p>
<p>As the symposium came to a close, the attendees gathered for a family photo, ready to take the next step in their journey towards a shared future. The Europe's Futures project and program will continue to provide a forum for discussion and engagement, ensuring that Europe is fully cognizant of the enormity of the task ahead and imbued with the spirit to navigate the uncharted waters of the future.</p>

<h1 id="europes-futures-annual-symposium-2024-reimagining-european-democracy">Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024: Reimagining European Democracy</h1>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 gathered prominent figures from academia, politics, and civil society to engage in a robust discussion on the future of European democracy. The symposium, held over several sessions, delved into a wide range of topics, from the EU's energy level and the People's Project to democratic deficits, participatory democracy, and the role of European citizens in decision-making processes. This chapter will synthesize and analyze the key points raised during the event, highlighting the pressing issues and potential solutions put forth by the speakers and participants.</p>
<h2 id="the-peoples-project-a-historical-perspective">The People's Project: A Historical Perspective</h2>
<p>Alberto Alano kicked off the symposium by reminding the audience of the People's Project, an initiative launched in the late 1990s by the British Labour government. The project aimed to rebrand the party and its policies under the banner of the 'Third Way,' a centrist political ideology that sought to move beyond the traditional divide between socialism and conservatism. Alano noted that the project was characterized by a strong emphasis on 'people, people, people' in its rhetoric, with then-Foreign Secretary Robin Cook even delivering a speech in Warsaw titled 'A People's Democracy for Europe.'</p>
<p>However, Alano also pointed out the limitations and eventual failure of the People's Project. He argued that while the project was successful in winning elections, it ultimately struggled to deliver meaningful change or resonate with the European public. The project's focus on 'people' remained largely rhetorical, failing to translate into concrete policies that addressed the pressing concerns of European citizens.</p>
<h2 id="democratic-deficits-and-the-participatory-toolbox">Democratic Deficits and the Participatory Toolbox</h2>
<p>Rosa Balfour and Nicolo Milanese picked up on Alano's historical analysis, focusing on the current democratic deficits within the European Union. They identified several key challenges facing European democracy today, including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of political space for European politics</strong>: The symposium participants noted that the current European electoral system is dominated by national politics, with European elections often serving as a proxy for domestic concerns. This leaves little room for a genuinely European political space.</li>
<li><strong>The technocratic nature of EU governance</strong>: Balfour and Milanese argued that the EU's governance structure is heavily technocratic, with decisions often made by unelected officials and experts. This has led to a democratic legitimacy crisis, as citizens feel increasingly disconnected from the EU's decision-making processes.</li>
<li><strong>The lack of a European public sphere</strong>: The speakers highlighted the absence of a shared European public sphere, which hampers meaningful debate and engagement on European issues. They noted that this is, in part, a result of the EU's focus on technical governance over political integration.</li>
</ol>
<p>To address these challenges, Balfour and Milanese proposed a 'participatory toolbox' for European democracy. They suggested that the EU could learn from the experiences of other political systems, such as Switzerland, to create new avenues for citizen engagement. Some of the tools they mentioned include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Citizen assemblies</strong>: These assemblies, composed of randomly selected citizens, could provide a more representative and deliberative basis for policy-making. They could be used to debate and make decisions on specific European issues.</li>
<li><strong>Transnational lists</strong>: These lists would allow European citizens to vote for candidates from other member states, fostering a more European political space.</li>
<li><strong>A European constituency</strong>: Balfour and Milanese proposed the creation of a European constituency, represented by a small number of MEPs, to provide a more direct link between European citizens and the EU's decision-making processes.</li>

<p>Nicolaidis, a fellow at the University of Belgrade, added to the conversation by suggesting that the process of EU enlargement could itself be democratized. He argued that the accession process often lacked meaningful citizen engagement, with decisions being made behind closed doors by elites. Nicolaidis proposed that EU enlargement could be made more democratic by:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Including a referendum in the accession process</strong>: This would allow citizens of candidate countries to directly express their support for EU membership.</li>
<li><strong>Creating a European constituency for candidate countries</strong>: This would give citizens of candidate countries a direct say in EU decision-making processes during the accession negotiations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nicolaidis also proposed that the concept of European citizenship be rethought, to better reflect the diverse and transnational nature of European societies. He suggested that European citizenship could be decoupled from national citizenship, allowing individuals to hold multiple European citizenships simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge-of-europeanization-and-electoral-reform">The Challenge of Europeanization and Electoral Reform</h2>
<p>The symposium participants also engaged in a lively debate on the topic of Europeanization and electoral reform. Some of the key points raised during this discussion included:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The need for synchronization of national and European elections</strong>: Several speakers, including Alberto Alano and Rosa Balfour, argued that synchronizing national and European elections would help foster a more European political space and encourage a more Europeanized political discourse.</li>
<li><strong>The limitations of transnational lists</strong>: While many speakers were supportive of the idea of transnational lists, others, such as Iana Botea, raised concerns about the practical limitations of such a system. Botea noted that transnational lists would likely only benefit larger political parties, potentially exacerbating the democratic deficit within the EU.</li>
<li><strong>The potential of a European political party</strong>: Some speakers, such as Stefan Auer, suggested that the creation of a European political party could help overcome some of the challenges facing European democracy. However, others, such as Iana Botea, were skeptical of this idea, noting that the creation of a European political party would likely require a significant shift in the EU's institutional structure.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion-reimagining-european-democracy">Conclusion: Reimagining European Democracy</h2>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 offered a rich and diverse range of perspectives on the state of European democracy and the challenges facing the continent today. The symposium participants identified several key challenges, including the lack of a European political space, the technocratic nature of EU governance, and the absence of a European public sphere. They also proposed a range of potential solutions, from the democratization of EU enlargement to the creation of new avenues for citizen engagement.</p>
<p>The symposium's discussions highlighted the need for a more holistic and integrated approach to European democratic renewal. Rather than focusing on a single 'magic bullet' solution, such as the creation of transnational lists or a European political party, European democrats would be well-advised to engage in a more sustained and systemic effort to reimagine European democracy. This would involve engaging with the EU's institutional structure, fostering a more Europeanized political discourse, and encouraging a more robust and diverse European public sphere.</p>
<p>As Europe continues to grapple with the challenges of the 21st century, from the climate crisis to the rise of illiberal democracy, the need for a more vibrant and democratic European Union has never been more pressing. The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 offered a valuable opportunity to engage in a critical and constructive conversation about the future of European democracy, and the steps needed to realize it. The symposium's participants and attendees would do well to build on the insights and ideas generated during the event, and to continue to push for a more democratic, vibrant, and integrated Europe.</p>

<h1 id="europes-futures-annual-symposium-2024-the-rise-of-far-right-politics-and-the-russian-ukrainian-war">Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024: The Rise of Far-Right Politics and the Russian-Ukrainian War</h1>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium, held in 2024, brought together scholars, policymakers, and experts to discuss the pressing issues facing the European continent. One of the most salient topics of discussion was the rise of far-right politics and its connection to the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war. This chapter will delve into the key points raised during a moderated session featuring Hannah Shelest, a researcher focusing on radicalization in the Western Balkans, and Peter Balash, a specialist in political spectrum analysis and conflict security. The session was titled "Russia's Aggression towards Ukraine: Populism, National Interest, and the Far Right."</p>
<h2 id="the-moderators-introduction">The Moderator's Introduction</h2>
<p>The moderator began the session by introducing Hannah Shelest and her research on radicalization in the Western Balkans, emphasizing its relevance to the current European election week. They also mentioned Peter Balash's expertise in political spectrum analysis and conflict security, noting that his insights would be valuable in understanding the far-right's response to Russia's aggression towards Ukraine.</p>
<h2 id="hannah-shelests-presentation">Hannah Shelest's Presentation</h2>
<p>Hannah Shelest started her presentation by acknowledging the significance of the ongoing European election week and the continued Russian aggression against Ukraine. She then discussed the trend of radicalization in the Western Balkans, using Serbia as an example. She argued that the radicalization of political discourse and the rise of far-right sentiment in the region were connected to the Russian-Ukrainian war. She posited that the war had unintended consequences, including a boost to European transatlantic unity but also a strengthening of far-right extremist parties across the continent.</p>
<p>Shelest noted that far-right parties in Europe, specifically in countries like France, the Netherlands, and Germany, were gaining traction. She attributed this to their opportunistic foreign policy, which often aligned with Russia's narrative and interests. She also highlighted the anti-establishment nature of many far-right parties, which connected them to the anti-imperialist and anti-Western sentiment that Russia has cultivated over the years.</p>
<p>Shelest concluded her presentation by raising the question of whether the far-right's anti-EU and anti-American stance would influence their position on Ukraine and the European Union's sanctions against Russia. She suggested that a closer look at the trends and future prospects of far-right politics in Europe was necessary to understand how they might shape the European response to the Russian-Ukrainian war.</p>
<h2 id="peter-balashs-comment">Peter Balash's Comment</h2>
<p>Peter Balash began his comment by agreeing with Hannah Shelest's analysis of the far-right's opportunistic foreign policy. He argued that far-right parties often took advantage of domestic issues to further their agenda, using the Russian-Ukrainian war as a means to bolster their support among voters. He also noted that the anti-establishment sentiment shared by many far-right parties made them natural allies of Russia, which has consistently positioned itself as an opponent of the Western liberal order.</p>
<p>Balash then discussed the role of ideology in shaping the far-right's response to the Russian-Ukrainian war. He argued that while far-right parties often shared a conservative, sovereignty-focused ideology, their reaction to the war was complex and varied. Some parties, like the AfD in Germany, supported Ukraine's right to self-defense while also praising Putin's strong leadership. Others, like the Lega in Italy, were more openly pro-Russian, viewing Russia as a key ally against the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p>Balash also touched on the role of Russia's disinformation campaigns in shaping public opinion and influencing far-right parties. He noted that Russia had consistently supported far-right parties across Europe, both financially and ideologically, as part of its broader strategy to undermine European unity and the liberal democratic order.</p>
<h2 id="the-moderated-discussion">The Moderated Discussion</h2>
<p>The moderator then opened the floor for a moderated discussion between Hannah Shelest and Peter Balash. The following are some of the key points they raised:</p>
<h3 id="the-far-rights-ambivalent-response-to-the-russian-ukrainian-war">The Far Right's Ambivalent Response to the Russian-Ukrainian War</h3>
<p>Both Shelest and Balash noted that the far-right's response to the Russian-Ukrainian war was ambivalent and complex. While many far-right parties supported Ukraine's right to self-defense, they also often expressed pro-Russian sentiments and aligned with Russia's narrative on the war. This ambivalence, they argued, was a result of the far-right's opportunistic and ideologically inconsistent nature.</p>
<h3 id="the-role-of-anti-immigration-sentiment-in-shaping-the-far-rights-response">The Role of Anti-Immigration Sentiment in Shaping the Far Right's Response</h3>
<p>Shelest and Balash discussed the role of anti-immigration sentiment in shaping the far-right's response to the Russian-Ukrainian war. They argued that far-right parties often used the war as a means to mobilize their anti-immigration base, painting Ukraine as a threat to Europe's borders and cultural integrity. They also noted that the war had led to a surge in anti-immigration sentiment across Europe, further bolstering the far-right's support.</p>
<h3 id="the-impact-of-the-war-on-european-unity">The Impact of the War on European Unity</h3>
<p>Both Shelest and Balash agreed that the Russian-Ukrainian war had had unintended consequences for European unity. While the war had initially brought Europeans closer together, with many countries united in their support for Ukraine and their opposition to Russia's aggression, the far-right's opportunistic and ambivalent response to the war had begun to undermine this unity. They argued that the far-right's ability to capitalize on domestic issues and align with Russia's narrative posed a significant threat to European cohesion.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-of-the-far-right-in-europe">The Future of the Far Right in Europe</h3>
<p>Shelest and Balash discussed the future prospects of the far-right in Europe, noting that the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war was likely to continue to shape their trajectory. They agreed that the war had provided the far-right with new opportunities to mobilize their base and gain traction among voters. However, they also noted that the far-right's response to the war was complex and varied, and that their ability to capitalize on the conflict would depend on a range of domestic and international factors.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium, held in 2024, provided a valuable opportunity to discuss the rise of far-right politics in Europe and its connection to the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war. Through the insights and analysis of Hannah Shelest and Peter Balash, the symposium highlighted the complex and varied nature of the far-right's response to the war, as well as the significant threat that this response posed to European unity. As the war continues to unfold, and the far-right's influence on European politics grows, understanding the factors shaping their response to the conflict will be crucial for those seeking to preserve the liberal democratic order in Europe.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-7-artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-democracy-a-symposium-on-europes-futures">Chapter 7: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Democracy: A Symposium on Europe's Futures</h1>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium, held in 2024, brought together thought leaders, academics, and policymakers to discuss the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) on democracy, education, and society at large. This chapter presents a detailed account of the proceedings, drawing from the symposium's opening remarks, keynote speeches, and panel discussions.</p>
<h2 id="opening-remarks">Opening Remarks</h2>
<p>The symposium kicked off with opening remarks from the event's moderator, who expressed their hope that the gathering would qualify as "the best moderated event I've ever been a part of." The moderator acknowledged the presence of Gregor Mikov, a researcher who had recently published a valuable empirical study on the role of AI in the Visegrád countries' polycrisis. The cover image of Mikov's publication, generated by AI, sparked a conversation about the potential for AI to mimic human creativity, with the moderator admitting they could not tell the difference between the AI-generated cover and one created by a human.</p>
<h2 id="keynote-speakers">Keynote Speakers</h2>
<h3 id="katy-hayward-ai-and-democracy">Katy Hayward: AI and Democracy</h3>
<p>Katy Hayward, a professor of political sociology at Queen's University Belfast and the codirector of the Center for International Border Research, delivered the symposium's opening keynote speech. Hayward began by expressing her gratitude to the Europe's Futures Fellowship for enabling her to respond to the "profoundly disturbing" image generated by AI and labeled "AI democracy." Hayward argued that universities must encourage students to grapple with the challenges posed by AI, as the technology has the potential to disrupt democratic processes, governance, and cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p>Hayward identified several ways in which AI poses a challenge to democracy, including privacy, freedom of expression, bias, and misinformation. She emphasized the importance of fostering discernment in education, arguing that universities must teach students to weigh evidence and scrutinize approving something demanding. Hayward suggested that the religious dimension of discernment is particularly important, as it requires patience, depth, and an objective approach to visible issues.</p>
<p>Hayward expressed concern about the commercialization of knowledge and the commodification of education, noting that universities must prioritize intellectual creativity and originality over functionality and convenience. She argued that the future of democracy depends on cultivating a new generation of thinkers who are capable of discernment, collaboration, and creativity.</p>
<h3 id="sonia-boan-liberal-arts-and-the-ai-revolution">Sonia Boan: Liberal Arts and the AI Revolution</h3>
<p>Sonia Boan, a professor at the Academy of Applied Arts in Paris and the executive director of the Center for Advanced Study in Southeast Europe, delivered the symposium's second keynote speech. Boan argued that the liberal arts are essential for fostering critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness in an era of AI.</p>
<p>Boan enumerated three pillars of liberal arts education: critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness. She presented a case study involving a prestigious photography award that was won by an AI-generated photograph, highlighting the need for critical evaluators who can discover and evaluate AI-generated content. Boan also discussed a dispute involving Cambridge Analytica, which used AI to link facial records and global surveillance data, violating privacy and endangering democracy.</p>
<p>Boan argued that the liberal arts are essential for developing human intelligence and avoiding the pitfalls of algorithmic bias and bullshitting. She emphasized the importance of fostering reflection, discernment, and the capacity for breaking patterns in education. Boan suggested that universities must prioritize critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness in an era of AI.</p>
<h2 id="panel-discussions">Panel Discussions</h2>

<h1 id="the-ghost-of-neo-nazism-on-neosa-street-a-case-study-of-culture-violence-and-state-complicity-in-serbia">The Ghost of Neo-Nazism on Neosa Street: A Case Study of Culture Violence and State Complicity in Serbia</h1>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 was abuzz with discussions on the rise of far-right ideologies and the need for a more inclusive Europe. Among the panelists was Vladimir Arsic, a prolific writer and cultural worker from Serbia, who presented a chilling case study of culture violence and state complicity in his home country. Arsic's topic of choice was the haunting presence of neo-nazism on Neosa Street in Belgrade, Serbia, and the complicity of the state in allowing it to fester.</p>
<h2 id="the-mural-of-madich-a-war-criminals-legacy">The Mural of Madich: A War Criminal's Legacy</h2>
<p>Arsic began his presentation by drawing the audience's attention to a particular mural on Neosa Street, a central thoroughfare in Belgrade. The mural depicted Ratko Mladić, the former Bosnian Serb army commander and convicted war criminal, who was responsible for the genocide of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in 1995. The mural, painted in 2021, showed Mladić as a hero, with the inscription "Thanks, Mother, for giving birth to a hero like Ratko Mladić" written below.</p>
<p>Arsic explained that the mural was part of a larger trend of right-wing extremism and neo-nazism that had been growing in Serbia in recent years. He noted that the mural was not an isolated incident, but part of a broader campaign by far-right groups to glorify war criminals and promote nationalist sentiment.</p>
<p>The mural of Mladić was not the only offensive graffiti on Neosa Street. Arsic pointed out another mural nearby, depicting a group of football hooligans affiliated with the partisan football club, a main perpetrator in the attack on the Kosovo Albanian town of Račak in 1999. The mural, stenciled by teenage football hooligans, was a clear line from partisan football club to the neo-nazis who had painted the mural of Mladić.</p>
<p>Arsic argued that the murals on Neosa Street were not simply acts of vandalism, but mechanisms for creating a particular understanding of the past. He noted that the murals were part of a deliberate strategy by the far-right to instrumentalize history for political ends.</p>
<h2 id="the-states-role-in-the-spread-of-neo-nazism">The State's Role in the Spread of Neo-Nazism</h2>
<p>Arsic was quick to point out that the far-right's campaign of culture violence would not have been possible without the complicity of the state. He noted that the police had not taken any action against the neo-nazis who had painted the mural of Mladić, despite the fact that it was a clear violation of the law.</p>
<p>Moreover, Arsic argued that the state had actively facilitated the spread of neo-nazism by rolling back laws that prohibited hate speech and banned neo-nazi organizations. He noted that the government had even gone so far as to hold a state-sponsored neo-nazi rally in 2014.</p>
<p>Arsic also pointed out that the state had failed to take any action against the neo-nazis who had attacked a group of Romani people in the town of Jagodina in 2012. The attack, which left one person dead and several others injured, was caught on camera and widely circulated on the internet. Yet, despite the overwhelming evidence, no one was ever held accountable for the attack.</p>
<p>Arsic argued that the state's complicity in the spread of neo-nazism was not simply a matter of negligence, but a deliberate strategy to harness the far-right's political power. He noted that the ruling party had been increasingly cozying up to neo-nazi groups in recent years, and that several high-ranking officials had been caught making neo-nazi salutes and using neo-nazi slogans.</p>
<h2 id="the-spillover-effect-neo-nazism-in-the-balkans">The Spillover Effect: Neo-Nazism in the Balkans</h2>
<p>Arsic noted that the rise of neo-nazism in Serbia was not an isolated phenomenon, but part of a broader trend in the Balkans. He pointed out that neo-nazi groups had been on the rise in Croatia, Bosnia, and Macedonia in recent years, and that there had been a worrying increase in hate crimes and hate speech in the region.</p>
<p>Arsic argued that the spread of neo-nazism in the Balkans was, in part, a consequence of the spillover effect of the conflicts in the region. He noted that the wars in the Balkans in the 1990s had left a legacy of ethnic hatred and nationalist sentiment, which had been exploited by far-right groups in recent years.</p>
<p>Arsic also pointed out that the economic crisis in the Balkans had exacerbated the situation, creating a breeding ground for far-right ideologies. He noted that the region had some of the highest unemployment rates and lowest levels of social welfare in Europe, and that this had created a sense of desperation and disillusionment among young people, who were particularly vulnerable to the siren calls of the far-right.</p>
<h2 id="the-way-forward-combating-culture-violence-and-state-complicity">The Way Forward: Combating Culture Violence and State Complicity</h2>
<p>Arsic concluded his presentation by arguing that the only way to combat the rise of neo-nazism and culture violence in Serbia and the Balkans was to challenge the complicity of the state. He noted that this would require a concerted effort by civil society groups, international organizations, and progressive political parties to hold the state accountable for its role in facilitating the spread of neo-nazism.</p>
<p>Arsic also pointed out that it was not enough to simply remove the offensive murals and graffiti from Neosa Street. He argued that this would only be a temporary solution, and that the underlying causes of culture violence and state complicity needed to be addressed.</p>
<p>Arsic proposed a number of steps that could be taken to combat culture violence and state complicity in Serbia and the Balkans. He noted that these would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthening independent media and civil society groups to hold the state accountable for its role in facilitating the spread of neo-nazism.</li>
<li>Promoting a more inclusive and accurate understanding of the past, and challenging the instrumentalization of history by the far-right.</li>
<li>Increasing funding for education and social welfare programs to address the underlying causes of the economic crisis in the Balkans.</li>
<li>Encouraging progressive political parties to challenge the far-right's political power, and to promote a more inclusive and democratic vision of the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arsic's presentation was a stark reminder of the dangers of culture violence and state complicity, and the need for a concerted effort to combat their spread in Serbia and the Balkans. His case study of Neosa Street served as a powerful illustration of the ways in which the far-right had been able to exploit the legacy of the conflicts in the region, and the complicity of the state in facilitating their rise to power. Arsic's proposals for the way forward, however, offered a glimmer of hope, and a roadmap for those who sought to challenge the far-right's political power and promote a more inclusive and democratic vision of the future.</p>
<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2>
<p>The audience was left with many questions after Arsic's presentation, and a lively Q&amp;A session followed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: How can we ensure that the state takes action against the far-right, when it has been complicit in their rise to power?</strong><ul>
<li>Arsic: That's a difficult question, and one that I don't have a easy answer to. I think that it will require a sustained effort by civil society groups, both in Serbia and internationally, to hold the state accountable. It will also require progressive political parties to challenge the far-right's political power, and to promote a more inclusive and democratic vision of the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q: What can international organizations do to support the fight against neo-nazism in the Balkans?</strong><ul>
<li>Arsic: International organizations can play a crucial role in supporting the fight against neo-nazism in the Balkans. They can provide funding and technical assistance to civil society groups, and they can use their leverage to hold the state accountable for its role in facilitating the spread of neo-nazism. They can also promote a more inclusive and accurate understanding of the past, and challenge the instrumentalization of history by the far-right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q: What role can education play in combating culture violence and state complicity?</strong><ul>
<li>Arsic: Education can play a crucial role in combating culture violence and state complicity. It can provide young people with a more inclusive and accurate understanding of the past, and equip them with the critical thinking skills they need to challenge the far-right's political power. It can also promote a more inclusive and democratic vision of the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the Q&amp;A session came to a close, the audience was left with a sense of the gravity of the situation, and the need for urgent action to combat the rise of neo-nazism and culture violence in Serbia and the Balkans. Arsic's presentation had served as a powerful reminder of the dangers of state complicity, and the need for a concerted effort to hold the state accountable and promote a more inclusive and democratic vision of the future.</p>

<h1 id="russias-past-present-and-future-a-symposium-on-historical-trajectories-and-political-prospects">Russia's Past, Present, and Future: A Symposium on Historical Trajectories and Political Prospects</h1>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium in 2024 convened an esteemed panel to discuss Russia's historical trajectories and political prospects. This chapter presents a transcript of the first panel, "Russia Click: Last Time at ECFR," moderated by Tom Deval, followed by a keynote lecture by Kadri Liiv, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). The panel featured Gregori Mikov, a senior research fellow at the Russian International Affairs Council, and Yuri Lada, a senior fellow at the Chatham House.</p>
<h2 id="russias-historical-trajectories-a-non-linear-path">Russia's Historical Trajectories: A Non-Linear Path</h2>
<p><strong>Tom Deval (TD)</strong>: Good evening, everyone. I'm Tom Deval, and it's my pleasure to moderate our first panel, "Russia Click: Last Time at ECFR." We'll have roughly 90 minutes, divided into three segments: a discussion on Russia's historical trajectories, a keynote lecture by Kadri Liiv, and an open Q&amp;A.</p>
<p><strong>TD</strong>: Let's start with Russia's history. History never moves in a straight line, as we've seen time and time again. Kadri, you've experienced Russia during the perestroika era. Can you share your perspective on Russia's historical trajectory?</p>
<p><strong>Kadri Liiv (KL)</strong>: Thank you, Tom. I was living in Estonia when I first visited Moscow in January 1987. I sensed Russia was a vast, exciting place I wanted to understand better. I kept going back, even during the war in the 1990s, and eventually moved to Moscow in 1997.</p>
<p>Russia often doesn't behave the way I expect it to, based on my formative experiences during the perestroika era. I've had to internalize that difference and write about Russia in a way that doesn't expect something positive that always ends in disappointment. Instead, I look for the fluid, creative time when rules changed from day to day.</p>
<p><strong>TD</strong>: Gregori, your thoughts on Russia's historical trajectory?</p>
<p><strong>Gregori Mikov (GM)</strong>: Russia's history is indeed non-linear. We've seen periods of openness and reform, followed by closures and retrenchments. The Soviet Union's collapse was not a linear process, nor was Putin's rise to power. Even the Ukrainian war is not following a straight line.</p>
<p>Russia's historical trajectory is characterized by competition between the state and society. The state has always sought to control society, and society has always resisted, sometimes violently. This dynamic is still at play today.</p>
<p><strong>Yuri Lada (YL)</strong>: I agree with Kadri and Gregori. Russia's history is marked by sudden shifts, not gradual changes. The Soviet Union's collapse was one such shift, and so was Putin's return to power in 2012. Today, we're witnessing another shift with the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia's historical trajectory is also characterized by a lack of a future-oriented concept. The idea of a democratic future died sometime in the 1990s. Today, Russia lacks a clear vision for its future, except for a vague notion of preserving its status as a great power.</p>
<h2 id="russia-today-a-personalist-regime">Russia Today: A Personalist Regime</h2>
<p><strong>TD</strong>: Thank you, Kadri, Gregori, and Yuri. Now, let's discuss Russia today. Yuri, you've interviewed many people from the Putin era. What's your take on Putin's regime?</p>
<p><strong>YL</strong>: Putin's regime is a personalist regime, with an overwhelming concentration of power in the hands of a few. The security services and the elite around Putin are heavily involved in the economy, and there's a prevalence of corruption. The regime relies on demobilization and passivity from the population, with a focus on stability over democracy.</p>
<p>However, Putin's regime is not a totalitarian regime. It's a hybrid dictatorship, relying on selective repression and targeted arrests, rather than mass repression. It also employs soft power tools, like state-owned media and cultural institutions, to maintain its grip on power.</p>
<p><strong>KL</strong>: I agree with Yuri. Putin's regime is personalist, and it relies on a combination of repression and co-optation to maintain power. However, I think the regime is weaker than it appears. The war in Ukraine has exposed its vulnerabilities, and there's a lot of discontent within the elite.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: I think Russia today is a state with imperialist aspirations, but it lacks the capacity to achieve them. The war in Ukraine has shown that Russia's military and economic power is overestimated. The regime is also facing internal challenges, with a growing number of protests and acts of dissent.</p>
<h2 id="russias-future-uncertain-and-dangerous">Russia's Future: Uncertain and Dangerous</h2>
<p><strong>TD</strong>: Finally, let's discuss Russia's future. Kadri, you've said that Russia's future is uncertain. Can you elaborate on that?</p>
<p><strong>KL</strong>: Russia's future is uncertain because the regime lacks a clear vision for the country. Putin's regime is focused on preserving power, not on building a better future for Russia. This uncertainty is dangerous, as it could lead to further instability and conflict.</p>
<p>I think there are several possible scenarios for Russia's future. One is a continuation of the current regime, with Putin or a successor maintaining power through repression and co-optation. Another is a gradual opening of the political system, with more space for civil society and opposition voices. A third is a more radical shift, with a change in the regime's nature or even a breakdown of the state.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: I think Russia's future is dangerous. The regime is facing internal challenges, and the war in Ukraine has exposed its vulnerabilities. If the regime feels threatened, it could lash out, leading to further conflict or even a civil war.</p>
<p>I also think that Russia's future is tied to its relationship with the West. If the West continues to impose sanctions and isolate Russia, it could lead to further radicalization of the regime. On the other hand, if the West engages with Russia, it could help to stabilize the regime and prevent further conflict.</p>
<p><strong>YL</strong>: I agree with Kadri and Gregori. Russia's future is uncertain and dangerous. The regime is facing internal challenges, and the war in Ukraine has shown that it's willing to take risks. If the regime feels threatened, it could lead to further repression or even a crackdown on the population.</p>
<p>I also think that Russia's future is tied to its relationship with the rest of the world. Russia is not isolated, and it's facing pressure from many sides. If the regime is unable to navigate these challenges, it could lead to further instability and conflict.</p>
<h2 id="kadri-liivs-keynote-lecture-russias-historical-trajectories-and-political-prospects">Kadri Liiv's Keynote Lecture: "Russia's Historical Trajectories and Political Prospects"</h2>
<p><strong>TD</strong>: Thank you, Kadri, Gregori, and Yuri. Now, let's move on to our keynote lecture by Kadri Liiv.</p>
<p><strong>KL</strong>: Thank you, Tom. I'd like to build on the discussion we just had and offer some thoughts on Russia's historical trajectories and political prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Russia's Historical Trajectories</strong></p>
<p>Russia's history is marked by sudden shifts, not gradual changes. The Soviet Union's collapse was one such shift, and so was Putin's return to power in 2012. Today, we're witnessing another shift with the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia's historical trajectory is also characterized by a lack of a future-oriented concept. The idea of a democratic future died sometime in the 1990s. Today, Russia lacks a clear vision for its future, except for a vague notion of preserving its status as a great power.</p>
<p><strong>Russia Today: A Personalist Regime</strong></p>
<p>Putin's regime is a personalist regime, with an overwhelming concentration of power in the hands of a few. The security services and the elite around Putin are heavily involved in the economy, and there's a prevalence of corruption. The regime relies on demobilization and passivity from the population, with a focus on stability over democracy.</p>
<p>However, Putin's regime is not a totalitarian regime. It's a hybrid dictatorship, relying on selective repression and targeted arrests, rather than mass repression. It also employs soft power tools, like state-owned media and cultural institutions, to maintain its grip on power.</p>
<p><strong>Russia's Future: Uncertain and Dangerous</strong></p>
<p>Russia's future is uncertain because the regime lacks a clear vision for the country. Putin's regime is focused on preserving power, not on building a better future for Russia. This uncertainty is dangerous, as it could lead to further instability and conflict.</p>
<p>I think there are several possible scenarios for Russia's future. One is a continuation of the current regime, with Putin or a successor maintaining power through repression and co-optation. Another is a gradual opening of the political system, with more space for civil society and opposition voices. A third is a more radical shift, with a change in the regime's nature or even a breakdown of the state.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Russia's history is marked by sudden shifts, not gradual changes. Today, we're witnessing another shift with the war in Ukraine. Russia's future is uncertain because the regime lacks a clear vision for the country. Putin's regime is focused on preserving power, not on building a better future for Russia. This uncertainty is dangerous, as it could lead to further instability and conflict.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>TD</strong>: Thank you, Kadri, for that insightful lecture.</p>
<p><strong>Open Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<p><strong>TD</strong>: Now, let's open the floor to questions. Who would like to start?</p>
<p><em>Audience member</em>: Thank you, Kadri, for your perspective. I'd like to ask, what do you think Russia's future would look like if the regime were to collapse?</p>
<p><strong>KL</strong>: That's a difficult question to answer, as it's not clear what would happen if the regime were to collapse. One possibility is that Russia would fragment, with different regions pursuing different political and economic trajectories. Another possibility is that a more democratic regime would emerge, with more space for civil society and opposition voices. A third possibility is that the regime would be replaced by an even more authoritarian regime. It's also possible that the regime would not collapse, but would instead continue to rule through repression and co-optation.</p>
<p><strong>TD</strong>: Thank you, Kadri, for that response. Who's next?</p>
<p><em>Another audience member</em>: I'd like to ask, what role do you think the West should play in shaping Russia's future?</p>
<p><strong>KL</strong>: I think the West has a role to play in shaping Russia's future, but it's not clear what that role should be. On the one hand, the West can use its leverage, through sanctions and diplomatic pressure, to push for a more democratic Russia. On the other hand, the West can also use its leverage to stabilize the regime and prevent further conflict. I think the key is to find a balance between pressure and engagement, and to work with Russia, not against it.</p>
<p><strong>TD</strong>: Thank you, Kadri, for that response. We have time for one more question.</p>
<p><em>Audience member</em>: Thank you, Kadri, for your insights. I'd like to ask, what do you think are the biggest challenges facing Russia today?</p>
<p><strong>KL</strong>: I think the biggest challenges facing Russia today are internal. The regime is facing internal challenges, with a growing number of protests and acts of dissent. The war in Ukraine has also exposed the regime's vulnerabilities, both in terms of its military capabilities and its domestic support. The regime also faces economic challenges, with a stagnant economy and a reliance on oil and gas exports. Finally, the regime faces demographic challenges, with a declining and aging population.</p>
<p><strong>TD</strong>: Thank you, Kadri, for that response, and thank you all for joining us tonight. That's all the time we have for questions.</p>

<h1 id="the-rise-of-populism-and-the-threat-to-liberal-democracy-in-slovakia">The Rise of Populism and the Threat to Liberal Democracy in Slovakia</h1>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 opened with an alarming discussion on the rise of populism and the threat it poses to liberal democracy, with a particular focus on Slovakia. The symposium, held on March 20, 2024, brought together experts from various fields to analyze the political landscape of Slovakia and its implications for the broader European Union.</p>
<h2 id="the-assassination-attempt-and-its-aftermath">The Assassination Attempt and its Aftermath</h2>
<p>The symposium began with a shocking revelation: the assassination attempt on the Slovak Prime Minister, Robert Fitz, had left him with serious injuries, and his recovery would take several months, if not a year. Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Robert Kak, was temporarily fulfilling his duties. The political situation was tense, with the ruling coalition blaming the opposition for the attempt on Fitz's life, while the opposition accused the government of using the incident to distract from its own failures. The assassination attempt, and the subsequent political fallout, had revealed deep-seated polarization within Slovak society.</p>
<h3 id="the-political-landscape-of-slovakia">The Political Landscape of Slovakia</h3>
<p>The political landscape of Slovakia can be divided into two main camps: the national populist camp, represented by parties such as the Slovak National Party and the People's Party - Our Slovakia, and the liberal democratic camp, represented by parties such as the Progressive Slovakia and the Democratic and Christian Union. The government, formed by a coalition of national populist and liberal democratic parties, had been a dramatic event in Slovak politics, marking the first time that these two ideological opposites had come together.</p>
<h3 id="the-rise-of-populism-in-slovakia">The Rise of Populism in Slovakia</h3>
<p>The rise of populism in Slovakia, as in other parts of Europe, can be attributed to several factors. The global economic crisis of 2008 had led to widespread dissatisfaction with the political establishment, creating an opening for populist parties to tap into the anger and frustration of the electorate. In Slovakia, this was exacerbated by the country's transition from communism to capitalism, which had left many people feeling left behind by the new economic order.</p>
<p>The rise of populism in Slovakia was also driven by the country's relationship with the European Union. Many Slovaks felt that the EU had not done enough to support their country's transition to democracy and capitalism, and that it was now imposing harsh austerity measures that were disproportionately affecting the poor and the middle class. This resentment was further fueled by the EU's response to the refugee crisis, which many Slovaks saw as an attempt to impose multiculturalism on their country against their will.</p>
<h3 id="the-threat-to-liberal-democracy">The Threat to Liberal Democracy</h3>
<p>The rise of populism in Slovakia posed a serious threat to liberal democracy. Populist parties, by their very nature, were hostile to many of the institutions and norms that underpinned liberal democracy, such as an independent judiciary, a free press, and protections for minorities. In Slovakia, this was evident in the government's attempts to dismantle the Office of the Special Prosecutor, which had been investigating corruption within the ruling coalition, and to muzzle the independent media.</p>
<p>The assassination attempt on Robert Fitz had brought these tensions to a head. The ruling coalition had used the opportunity to accuse the opposition of being responsible for the attack, and to try to silence any criticism of the government. The opposition, meanwhile, had accused the government of using the attempt on Fitz's life to distract from its own failings. This polarization had created a dangerous political climate, in which the very foundations of liberal democracy were under threat.</p>
<h3 id="the-role-of-the-media-and-civil-society">The Role of the Media and Civil Society</h3>
<p>The media and civil society played a crucial role in Slovakia's democratic transition, and they continued to be vital in defending liberal democracy against the threat of populism. However, they were under threat from the government, which had tried to muzzle the independent media and to undermine the independence of the public broadcaster, Radio and Television Slovakia.</p>
<p>Civil society organizations, meanwhile, were under pressure from the government's attempt to introduce new legislation that would make it harder for them to operate. This legislation was widely seen as an attempt to silence dissenting voices and to consolidate the government's power. The government's attempts to undermine the independence of the media and civil society were a clear indication of its authoritarian tendencies.</p>
<h3 id="the-international-context">The International Context</h3>
<p>The rise of populism in Slovakia was part of a broader trend across Europe and beyond. Populist parties were gaining traction in many countries, from the United States to the Philippines, from Brazil to India. This trend had been driven by a range of factors, including economic inequality, cultural anxiety, and a sense of disillusionment with the political establishment.</p>
<p>The international context was also important in understanding the threat that populism posed to liberal democracy. Populist parties were often supported by foreign powers, such as Russia and China, which saw them as a way to weaken the liberal democratic order. In Slovakia, for example, the government had taken a pro-Russian stance on issues such as Ukraine and the refugee crisis, and had been accused of being too close to Moscow.</p>
<h3 id="the-way-forward_1">The Way Forward</h3>
<p>The symposium ended with a discussion of what could be done to counter the threat of populism and to defend liberal democracy in Slovakia and beyond. The experts agreed that a multi-faceted approach was needed, involving a combination of political, economic, and social reforms.</p>
<p>Politically, this meant strengthening democratic institutions, such as the judiciary and the media, and promoting a more inclusive and pluralistic political culture. Economically, it meant addressing the underlying causes of inequality and economic insecurity, which had driven many people to support populist parties. Socially, it meant promoting a more inclusive and cohesive society, in which people from different backgrounds felt that they had a stake in the political system.</p>
<p>The symposium ended with a call to action for all those who believed in liberal democracy. The threat of populism was real, and it would take sustained effort and commitment from all sectors of society to defend and promote liberal democratic values. The future of Slovakia, and of Europe, depended on it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion_2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 provided a stark warning of the threat that populism posed to liberal democracy, both in Slovakia and beyond. The rise of populism in Slovakia, driven by economic inequality, cultural anxiety, and a sense of disillusionment with the political establishment, had created a dangerous political climate in which the very foundations of liberal democracy were under threat. The symposium ended with a call to action for all those who believed in liberal democracy, reminding us that the future of our societies depended on our collective efforts to defend and promote democratic values. The battle against populism would be long and difficult, but it was a battle that we could not afford to lose.</p>

<h1 id="strengthening-democracy-in-central-and-eastern-europe-the-role-of-citizen-assemblies">Strengthening Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe: The Role of Citizen Assemblies</h1>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 convened a diverse range of experts to discuss strategies for enhancing democracy in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). At the heart of the deliberations was the exploration of the potential benefits of citizen assemblies in addressing authoritarian tendencies and fostering a more inclusive, participatory democratic landscape. This chapter will delve into the key arguments presented during the symposium, focusing on the diagnostic analysis of democratic erosion in CEE, the explanatory analysis of citizen assemblies as a potential remedy, and the normative analysis of the impact of such assemblies on democratic resilience.</p>
<h2 id="the-state-of-democracy-in-central-and-eastern-europe-a-diagnostic-analysis">The State of Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe: A Diagnostic Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="the-democratic-erosion-threat">The Democratic Erosion Threat</h3>
<p>The symposium opened with a stark warning about the state of democracy in CEE. A presenter, who wished to remain anonymous, began by citing a World Population Review report from March 2024, which indicated that 71% of the world's population lives in autocratic states, with low trust in governments and widespread disillusionment with democratic systems (World Population Review, 2024). This global trend, the presenter argued, was not immune to CEE, where internal power capture, foreign interference, and democratic erosion have become increasingly prevalent.</p>
<h3 id="internal-power-capture-and-foreign-interference">Internal Power Capture and Foreign Interference</h3>
<p>The presenter identified internal power capture and foreign interference as significant threats to CEE democracies. They argued that disinformation, division, and the willingness to fracture and weaken democratic institutions were key tactics employed by populist forces seeking to undermine democratic norms. The presenter also noted that young democratic institutions in CEE were particularly vulnerable to these threats, with limited citizen engagement and a hierarchical political culture exacerbating the situation.</p>
<h3 id="democratic-erosion-a-constant-state-of-becoming">Democratic Erosion: A Constant State of Becoming</h3>
<p>The presenter challenged the notion of democracy as a living, breathing thing that evolves constantly. Instead, they posited that democracies can become "a constant state of becoming," where internal power capture, foreign interference, and democratic erosion are ongoing processes. This perspective underscores the need for vigilant and innovative democratic defense strategies.</p>
<h2 id="citizen-assemblies-an-explanatory-analysis">Citizen Assemblies: An Explanatory Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="the-potential-of-citizen-assemblies-in-cee">The Potential of Citizen Assemblies in CEE</h3>
<p>The presenter argued that citizen assemblies could play a crucial role in strengthening democracies in CEE. They explained that these assemblies, composed of randomly selected citizens who deliberate on specific policy issues, offer two key benefits: deeper participation and deliberation. Unlike participatory democracy, which seeks to involve as many people as possible, deliberative democracy focuses on involving people who would not otherwise participate, fostering a more diverse and representative decision-making process.</p>
<h3 id="the-deliberative-wave-in-the-western-world">The Deliberative Wave in the Western World</h3>
<p>The presenter noted that a deliberative wave has been rising in the Western world, with numerous citizen assemblies taking place across the globe. However, they observed that this trend had not yet reached CEE, where only a handful of assemblies have been implemented. To analyze the potential benefits of citizen assemblies in CEE, the presenter conducted a study of 37 assemblies in the region and interviewed practitioners and policymakers involved in these initiatives.</p>
<h3 id="learning-from-western-citizen-assemblies">Learning from Western Citizen Assemblies</h3>
<p>The presenter analyzed the data from their study and drew several lessons from citizen assemblies in the Western world. They found that these assemblies have yielded better policy outcomes, enhanced minority inclusion, increased transparency, and signaled citizens' value in decision-making processes. Moreover, the presenter argued that embedding citizen assemblies within systemic decision-making processes can promote a more deliberative functioning of institutions, moving away from adversarial approaches.</p>
<h2 id="the-normative-analysis-impact-on-democratic-resilience">The Normative Analysis: Impact on Democratic Resilience</h2>
<h3 id="strengthening-resilient-democracies">Strengthening Resilient Democracies</h3>
<p>The presenter contended that citizen assemblies could help build resilient democracies in CEE by addressing the challenges of internal power capture, foreign interference, and democratic erosion. They argued that assemblies could foster a more informed and engaged citizenry, empowering people to resist authoritarian tendencies and defend democratic norms.</p>
<h3 id="the-case-for-strategic-use-of-citizen-assemblies">The Case for Strategic Use of Citizen Assemblies</h3>
<p>The presenter acknowledged the potential for citizen assemblies to be hijacked by populist forces but emphasized that they could also be strategically employed to address divisive issues constructively. By involving a diverse range of citizens in deliberations on complex policy matters, assemblies can help inform the public, raise the quality of debate, and promote evidence-based decision-making.</p>
<h3 id="the-need-for-deliberative-quality-and-political-commitment">The Need for Deliberative Quality and Political Commitment</h3>
<p>In response to skepticism about the value of citizen assemblies, the presenter emphasized the importance of deliberative quality and political commitment. They argued that assemblies must be designed and implemented in a way that ensures the representation of diverse viewpoints, fosters informed deliberation, and protects against manipulation. Additionally, the presenter underscored the need for political support and commitment to ensure that assembly recommendations are taken forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-deliberative-democracy-in-cee">The Future of Deliberative Democracy in CEE</h2>
<h3 id="the-potential-for-european-guidelines">The Potential for European Guidelines</h3>
<p>As the symposium drew to a close, the presenter raised the possibility of developing European guidelines for citizen assemblies. They argued that such guidelines could help address the challenge of populist hijacking and ensure that assemblies are designed and implemented in a way that promotes deliberative quality and political commitment.</p>
<h3 id="the-need-for-international-collaboration">The Need for International Collaboration</h3>
<p>The presenter also emphasized the importance of international collaboration in promoting deliberative democracy in CEE. They noted that practitioners and policymakers in the region had already begun to share knowledge and resources, and that this exchange of ideas could be further facilitated through regional and European-level initiatives.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion_3">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 highlighted the pressing need to strengthen democracies in Central and Eastern Europe, where internal power capture, foreign interference, and democratic erosion pose significant threats. The symposium explored the potential of citizen assemblies as a means of fostering a more inclusive, participatory democratic landscape and promoting democratic resilience. Through a diagnostic analysis of the democratic erosion threat, an explanatory analysis of the potential benefits of citizen assemblies, and a normative analysis of the impact of such assemblies on democratic resilience, the symposium offered a comprehensive assessment of the role of deliberative democracy in CEE.</p>
<p>As the symposium drew to a close, participants were left with a sense of optimism about the potential for citizen assemblies to contribute to the defense of democracy in CEE. However, they also recognized the need for vigilance, innovation, and international collaboration in ensuring that these assemblies are designed, implemented, and supported in a way that maximizes their potential for promoting deliberative quality, political commitment, and democratic resilience.</p>

<h2 id="erhard-busek-memorial-lecture-wolfgang-petritsch">Erhard Busek Memorial Lecture: Wolfgang Petritsch</h2>
<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFKtdngwe3o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFKtdngwe3o</a></p>
<h1 id="chapter-9-aart-p-k-memorial-lecture-wang-petri-contestation-and-the-new-dynamics-of-global-politics">Chapter 9: Aart P. K. Memorial Lecture - Wang Petri: Contestation and the New Dynamics of Global Politics</h1>
<p>The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 was a special occasion, not least because it marked the fourth iteration of the Aart P. K. Memorial Lecture. The previous year had seen former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou deliver the lecture, and this year, the honor fell to Wang Petri, a distinguished senior Austrian diplomat with a career spanning significant positions at the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the United Nations. The stage was set in the grand auditorium of the University of Vienna's Centre for Advanced Studies, a legacy honoring Aart PK's instrumental role in its establishment.</p>
<h2 id="an-introduction-to-wang-petri">An Introduction to Wang Petri</h2>
<p>Wang Petri's professional journey was as impressive as it was varied. He served as the International High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1997 to 2002, a role that placed him at the heart of the international community's efforts to rebuild the war-torn country. His tenure coincided with the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999, an event that marked a turning point in international relations and one that Petri played a significant role in navigating.</p>
<p>Petri's diplomatic portfolio was extensive. He served as the EU's Special Representative for Kosovo, the French representative to the EU's Political and Security Committee, and the Austrian Ambassador to Belgrade. He also held the position of Austria's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and the OECD in Geneva. Most recently, he served as the President of the Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation, a position he still holds.</p>
<p>Despite his illustrious career, Wang Petri remained a humble and approachable figure. His relationship with Aart PK was one of mutual respect and shared understanding, a testament to the power of mentorship and friendship in the often complex world of international diplomacy.</p>
<h2 id="a-sweeping-overview-of-the-current-geopolitical-situation">A Sweeping Overview of the Current Geopolitical Situation</h2>
<p>Wang Petri began his lecture with a sweeping overview of the current geopolitical situation, a topic he titled "Contestation and the New Dynamics of Global Politics." He noted the end of the post-1945 Western-centric global order, a shift that had been building for decades but was accelerated by the Russian aggression in Ukraine in 2022.</p>
<p>Petri drew on the words of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who had proclaimed the end of the post-Cold War era and the beginning of a multipolar world as early as 2023. He noted that while the end of the Cold War had brought a period of relative calm and optimism, it was a period that was now firmly in the past. The world was once again in a state of flux, with new power dynamics emerging and old alliances fraying.</p>
<p>Petri quoted French President Emmanuel Macron, who had warned in 2017 of Europe's "mortal danger" and the need for a sovereign, autonomous Europe. He noted that Macron's words had taken on a new urgency in the wake of Russia's aggression, with the European Union now facing a existential crisis that required swift and decisive action.</p>
<p>Petri also touched on the rise of China, a country that had successfully challenged the Western narrative that democracy and capitalism were the only viable systems of governance. He noted the growing gap between the rich and the poor, both within and between nations, and the rise of identitarian nationalism, a phenomenon that was threatening to tear apart the fabric of multicultural societies.</p>
<h2 id="the-nation-state-in-a-borderless-world">The Nation-State in a Borderless World</h2>
<p>Petri turned his attention to the nation-state, an institution that he argued was losing its traction in a world that was increasingly borderless. He quoted Polish-British philosopher Zygmunt Bauman, who had argued that the nation-state had lost its ability to keep its promises of prosperity and security in a globalized world.</p>
<p>Petri noted that the end of the Cold War had brought a new era of optimism, one that had seen the nation-state expand its reach through globalization. However, this expansion had also brought new challenges, not least the growing sense of uncertainty and vulnerability that many people felt in a world that was increasingly interconnected but also increasingly unpredictable.</p>
<p>Petri argued that the nation-state was no longer the primary actor in global politics. Instead, it was multinational corporations, tech giants, and non-state actors that were shaping the world. He noted that while these actors were often more efficient than nation-states, they were also more accountable, with their decisions often made behind closed doors and beyond the reach of democratic oversight.</p>
<h2 id="europes-role-in-the-emerging-multipolar-world">Europe's Role in the Emerging Multipolar World</h2>
<p>Petri turned his attention to Europe, a continent that he argued was at a crossroads. He noted that Europe had the potential to play a crucial role in the emerging multipolar world, acting as a bridge between the United States and China and as a leader in areas such as climate change, digital regulation, and human rights.</p>
<p>However, Petri also noted that Europe was facing significant challenges. He pointed to the widening gap between the rich and the poor, both within and between EU member states, and the rise of populism and nationalism, phenomena that were threatening to tear apart the fabric of European integration.</p>
<p>Petri argued that Europe needed to adopt a new mental map of the world, one that recognized the reality of power politics and the need to balance the enforcement of existing rules with innovation and global justice. He pointed to the European Neighborhood Policy as an example of a policy that needed to be revised in light of the new geopolitical reality, arguing that Europe needed to be consistent in its dealings with countries like Ukraine and Gaza.</p>
<h2 id="a-call-to-action">A Call to Action</h2>
<p>Petri ended his lecture with a call to action, urging Europe to take the challenges and opportunities of the emerging multipolar world seriously. He argued that Europe needed to adopt a spirit of "spiritus Rector," a phrase coined by the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga, that combined a sense of responsibility with a willingness to take risks and think beyond conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>Petri noted that the task ahead was daunting, but he was optimistic that Europe had the potential to play a crucial role in shaping the new global order. He ended his lecture with a quote from Hannah Arendt, urging his audience to go "next step by step" and to "take responsibility for the world."</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wang Petri's lecture was a timely and insightful exploration of the challenges and opportunities facing Europe and the world in the wake of the Russian aggression in Ukraine. He argued that the end of the post-1945 Western-centric global order was a reality that Europe needed to confront head-on, and he urged Europe to adopt a new mental map of the world, one that recognized the reality of power politics and the need to balance the enforcement of existing rules with innovation and global justice.</p>
<p>Petri's lecture was a fitting tribute to Aart PK, a man who had dedicated his life to the pursuit of peace, justice, and understanding in a complex and often turbulent world. It was a reminder that while the challenges facing the world were many and varied, they were not insurmountable. With courage, creativity, and a spirit of responsibility, Europe and the world could navigate the treacherous waters of the 21st century and emerge stronger and more united.</p>
<p>As the audience applauded, Wang Petri took his seat, his words echoing in the grand auditorium. The future, as always, remained uncertain, but with speakers like Wang Petri guiding the way, there was reason to hope that Europe and the world could navigate the challenges ahead and emerge stronger and more united.</p>

<h1 id="futures-annual-symposium-2024-a-new-vision-for-european-democracy">Futures Annual Symposium 2024: A New Vision for European Democracy</h1>
<p>The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 was a vibrant gathering of European thought leaders, policymakers, and academics, convened to discuss the future of European democracy. The event, held over several days, saw an array of speakers and attendees engaging in robust debates and sharing innovative ideas. This chapter will delve into the key discussions, focusing on the keynote session titled "Energy Level Kept Going: A Session on Europe's People Project," and the subsequent panel discussions that explored the theme of democratizing Europe.</p>
<h2 id="the-people-project-a-vision-of-european-solidarity">The People Project: A Vision of European Solidarity</h2>
<p>The keynote session began with a fascinating reflection on the origins of the "People Project," an initiative that aimed to redefine Europe through the lens of its citizens. Alberto Alano, a prominent figure in the European integration process, took the audience on a journey through time, recalling the inception of the project in the late 1990s under the New Labour government in the UK. The project sought to articulate a new vocabulary to describe a post-socialist, post-Cold War Europe, ultimately leading to the coining of the term "Third Way."</p>
<p>Alano recounted how the project gained momentum in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with Robin Cook, then the British Foreign Secretary, embarking on a tour of Central Europe to promote the idea of a "People's Democracy in Europe." However, the project faced challenges and misunderstandings, with some, like the Polish Prime Minister at the time, Leszek Miller, struggling to grasp the concept of a "People's Republic of Europe." Despite these hurdles, the People Project remained a vision of European solidarity, a vision that Alano believed was more relevant than ever in the present day.</p>
<h2 id="europes-democratic-deficit-a-multifaceted-crisis">Europe's Democratic Deficit: A Multifaceted Crisis</h2>
<p>The symposium then turned its attention to Europe's democratic deficit, a pressing issue that had been exacerbated by various crises in recent years. Rosa Balfour, a prominent European political scientist, kicked off the discussion by outlining the multiple dimensions of this crisis. She highlighted the regression of democratic standards in several EU member states, notably in Poland and Hungary, and the decline in democratic quality across Europe as a whole since 2006.</p>
<p>Balfour also touched on the rise of far-right and anti-European sentiments, as well as the growing demand for greater say in local politics. She argued that the European Union had failed to address these issues, instead opting for a technocratic approach that had left citizens disenchanted and disempowered. Balfour called for a holistic approach to address the democratic deficit, one that acknowledged the interconnected nature of the crisis.</p>
<h2 id="the-eus-technocratic-governance-a-barrier-to-democracy">The EU's Technocratic Governance: A Barrier to Democracy</h2>
<p>Nicola Dimitro, another esteemed panelist, expanded on the theme of the EU's technocratic governance. He argued that the European Union's focus on economic integration and market liberalization had come at the expense of democratic accountability. The EU's obsession with harmonization and convergence had led to a homogenization of political participation and a de-politicization of European integration.</p>
<p>Dimitro also raised concerns about the EU's approach to enlargement, noting that the accession of new member states had often been driven by economic and geopolitical considerations rather than democratic ones. He called for a rethinking of the accession process, one that prioritized democratic conditionality and encouraged experimentation at the national level.</p>
<h2 id="the-eus-democratic-innovation-a-path-forward">The EU's Democratic Innovation: A Path Forward</h2>
<p>The symposium then explored potential avenues for democratizing Europe. Alberto Alano proposed the creation of a transnational list, allowing European citizens living in another EU country to vote for a candidate from their country of origin. This, he argued, would address the disenfranchisement of European expats and create a new channel for political participation.</p>
<p>Rosa Balfour, meanwhile, called for a reimagining of the EU's electoral system, with a particular focus on the European Parliament elections. She proposed a system that would allow European citizens to vote for a candidate from any EU country, a system that would encourage a more European-wide debate and create a truly transnational political space.</p>
<p>Nicola Dimitro, for his part, argued for a more nuanced approach to democratizing Europe. He suggested that the EU encourage experimentation at the national level, allowing member states to test different models of political participation and democratic governance. This, he believed, would foster a more dynamic and innovative European democracy.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-european-democracy-a-work-in-progress">The Future of European Democracy: A Work in Progress</h2>
<p>The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 ended on a hopeful note, with panelists and attendees alike expressing a renewed commitment to the project of democratizing Europe. The symposium had highlighted the myriad challenges facing European democracy, from the democratic backsliding in several member states to the EU's technocratic approach to integration. Yet, it had also offered a range of innovative solutions, from the creation of transnational lists to the experimentation with different electoral systems.</p>
<p>The road ahead was far from clear. The task of democratizing Europe was a complex and daunting one, requiring sustained effort and imagination from policymakers, academics, and citizens alike. But as the symposium had shown, the will to pursue this project was strong, and the ideas for how to achieve it were manifold. The future of European democracy, then, was a work in progress, a project that was far from complete, but one that was well underway.</p>
<p>In the end, the Futures Annual Symposium 2024 served as a powerful reminder of the vitality of European democracy, and of the potential for Europeans to shape a future that was more democratic, more participatory, and more truly European.</p>

<h1 id="the-resurgence-of-far-right-politics-and-the-russia-ukraine-war">The Resurgence of Far-Right Politics and the Russia-Ukraine War</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the global political landscape has been reshaped, with far-right political parties and ideologies gaining traction across Europe. The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 brought together leading experts in the field to discuss the rise of far-right populism, the role of national interest in international relations, and the consequences of Russian aggression towards Ukraine. This chapter will delve into the key insights and debates from the symposium, focusing on the intersection of far-right politics, national interest, and the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
<h2 id="the-rise-of-far-right-populism-in-europe">The Rise of Far-Right Populism in Europe</h2>
<p>The symposium kicked off with a presentation by Hannah Shelest, a specialist in far-right political parties and radicalization in the Western Balkans. Shelest argued that the rise of far-right populism in Europe was not a new phenomenon, but rather a resurgence of ideas that had been simmering beneath the surface for decades. She identified several factors contributing to the growth of far-right parties, including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Economic insecurity</strong>: The 2008 global economic crisis and subsequent austerity measures left many Europeans feeling economically precarious, creating fertile ground for far-right parties that promised to protect national interests and curb immigration.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural backlash</strong>: Far-right parties have exploited anxieties about cultural change, particularly around immigration and the rise of multiculturalism, appealing to those who feel left behind by globalization and social progress.</li>
<li><strong>Political disillusionment</strong>: The failure of mainstream political parties to address the concerns of ordinary people has led to a growing sense of disillusionment with democratic institutions, fueling support for far-right alternatives.</li>
</ol>
<p>Shelest also highlighted the role of social media and the internet in facilitating the spread of far-right ideologies. She noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had exacerbated these trends, with far-right groups using the crisis to promote their agendas and gain new recruits.</p>
<h2 id="far-right-parties-and-the-russia-ukraine-war">Far-Right Parties and the Russia-Ukraine War</h2>
<p>The symposium panel, moderated by Peter Balash, explored the relationship between far-right parties and the Russia-Ukraine war. Balash opened the discussion by noting that the war had both unintended consequences, such as strengthening European transatlantic unity, and intended consequences, such as the rise of far-right extremist parties in certain countries.</p>
<p>Balash invited Shelest to expand on her research findings on the radicalization of far-right parties in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. Shelest pointed out that the war had served to polarize societies across Europe, with far-right parties seizing on anti-immigrant and anti-establishment sentiment to gain support. She noted that far-right parties had been particularly successful in countries like France, the Netherlands, and Germany, where they had capitalized on public discontent with the government's handling of the refugee crisis and its perceived failure to prioritize national interests.</p>
<p>Balash then posed a key question: what role do far-right parties play in shaping European foreign policy, particularly with regard to the Russia-Ukraine war? The panelists offered a range of perspectives on this issue.</p>
<h3 id="the-role-of-national-interest">The Role of National Interest</h3>
<p>Shelest argued that far-right parties often prioritize national interest in their foreign policy stances, particularly when it comes to issues like immigration, border control, and military intervention. She noted that far-right parties in countries like Hungary and Poland had taken a more pro-Russian stance on the Ukraine issue, citing concerns about NATO expansion and the need to protect national sovereignty.</p>
<p>Balash countered that the focus on national interest was not unique to far-right parties, and that mainstream conservative parties also emphasized national interest in their foreign policy stances. He argued that the key difference was that far-right parties often employed more radical and divisive rhetoric, which could have dangerous consequences for democratic stability.</p>
<h3 id="far-right-parties-and-the-russia-ukraine-war_1">Far-Right Parties and the Russia-Ukraine War</h3>
<p>The panelists agreed that far-right parties had responded to the Russia-Ukraine war in a variety of ways, with some embracing a pro-Russian stance and others condemning Russian aggression. Shelest noted that far-right parties in countries like Italy and Austria had been particularly supportive of Russia, while parties in countries like France and Germany had been more critical of Russian actions.</p>
<p>Balash pointed out that far-right parties had also used the war to promote their anti-immigrant and anti-establishment agendas. He noted that far-right parties in countries like the Netherlands and Germany had capitalized on public discontent with the government's handling of the refugee crisis and its perceived failure to prioritize national interests.</p>
<h3 id="the-consequences-of-russian-aggression">The Consequences of Russian Aggression</h3>
<p>The panelists also discussed the potential consequences of Russian aggression towards Ukraine for European politics and security. Shelest argued that the war had exposed the fragility of European security and the need for greater cooperation between European nations. She noted that the war had also led to a newfound appreciation for the importance of transatlantic unity, with many Europeans now recognizing the need for closer ties with the United States.</p>
<p>Balash countered that the war had also exacerbated divisions within Europe, with some countries, like Hungary and Poland, taking a more pro-Russian stance and others, like France and Germany, taking a more critical view of Russian actions. He argued that these divisions could have dangerous consequences for European security and stability.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-far-right-politics-and-the-russia-ukraine-war">The Future of Far-Right Politics and the Russia-Ukraine War</h2>
<p>As the symposium drew to a close, the panelists offered their predictions for the future of far-right politics and the Russia-Ukraine war. Shelest argued that the war had brought far-right parties to the forefront of European politics, and that they would continue to gain traction in the coming years. She noted that far-right parties would continue to exploit public discontent with immigration, cultural change, and economic insecurity, capitalizing on these issues to gain new recruits and influence mainstream political discourse.</p>
<p>Balash agreed that far-right parties would continue to pose a significant threat to European democracy, but he also expressed optimism about the future of European security. He argued that the Russia-Ukraine war had exposed the need for greater cooperation between European nations and closer ties with the United States. He noted that the war had also led to a newfound appreciation for the importance of democratic values and institutions, which he believed would help to safeguard European security and stability in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion_1">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 brought together leading experts in the field to discuss the rise of far-right populism, the role of national interest in international relations, and the consequences of Russian aggression towards Ukraine. The symposium panel highlighted the complex and multifaceted nature of far-right politics, noting that far-right parties had responded to the Russia-Ukraine war in a variety of ways and that their influence on European politics and security was likely to be significant in the coming years.</p>
<p>As the global political landscape continues to evolve, it is clear that far-right parties will remain a powerful force in European politics. The Russia-Ukraine war has exposed the fragility of European security and the need for greater cooperation between European nations and closer ties with the United States. As Europe looks to the future, it will be crucial for political leaders to address the concerns of ordinary people and to promote democratic values and institutions that safeguard European security and stability.</p>

<p>The 2024 Futures Annual Symposium, held under the auspices of the European Futures Network, gathered leading scholars and experts to explore the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on academia, democracy, and society. This chapter presents a transcript of the symposium's morning session, which sparked robust debates and offered insights into the promise and perils of AI in the academic realm.</p>
<h2 id="opening-remarks">Opening Remarks</h2>
<p>The symposium kicked off with a welcome address by <strong>German</strong>, a professor of political science, who expressed optimism about the event's potential to foster meaningful discussions on AI's implications for academia and democracy. He highlighted the importance of the European Futures Fellowship in enabling such conversations and emphasized the need for academic rigor and ethical discernment in AI's application.</p>
<p><strong>Katy Hayward</strong>, a professor of political sociology at Queen's University Belfast and the symposium's keynote speaker, opened the session by presenting a thought-provoking image generated by AI, depicting a dystopian future where AI has taken over academic endeavors. She expressed gratitude for the European Futures Fellowship, which had facilitated her reflection on AI's challenges to democracy and academia.</p>
<h2 id="keynote-address-katy-hayward-ai-and-the-future-of-democracy">Keynote Address: Katy Hayward - "AI and the Future of Democracy"</h2>
<p>Hayward began by acknowledging the potential of AI to revolutionize academia, offering new tools for research and enhancing productivity. However, she raised critical concerns about AI's impact on democracy, focusing on three main challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy and surveillance</strong>: AI's ability to process vast amounts of data raises concerns about privacy and the potential for mass surveillance. Hayward cited the example of Cambridge Analytica, which used AI to influence political outcomes by manipulating user data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bias and misinformation</strong>: AI algorithms can perpetuate and amplify existing biases, leading to unfair outcomes. Moreover, AI-generated content can contribute to the spread of misinformation, further undermining democratic processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Autonomy and decision-making</strong>: AI's autonomous nature raises questions about human agency and accountability. As AI systems increasingly influence decisions, it becomes crucial to consider their potential impact on democratic institutions and processes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hayward argued that academia must play a crucial role in addressing these challenges. She called for a shift in the university's mission, emphasizing the need to nurture critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness among students. Hayward proposed a three-pillar approach to liberal arts education that fosters these competencies, enabling students to navigate the complexities of AI and democracy.</p>
<h2 id="panel-discussion-ai-in-academia-opportunities-and-threats">Panel Discussion: "AI in Academia - Opportunities and Threats"</h2>
<p>Following Hayward's keynote, a panel discussion featuring <strong>Luke Cooper</strong>, a researcher at the University of Cambridge; <strong>Sonia Boan</strong>, a professor at the Academy of Applied Arts in Paris; and <strong>Peter Greer</strong>, a professor at the University of Warwick, explored AI's opportunities and threats in academia.</p>
<h3 id="artificial-intelligence-as-a-tool-for-enhancing-productivity">Artificial Intelligence as a Tool for Enhancing Productivity</h3>
<p>Cooper began by acknowledging AI's potential to enhance productivity and efficiency in academia. He cited examples such as AI-powered chatbots for student support and AI algorithms for grading essays. However, he cautioned that over-reliance on AI could lead to deskilling and devaluation of human labor.</p>
<p>Boan echoed Cooper's sentiments, noting that AI could help automate tedious tasks, freeing up academics' time for more creative and meaningful work. She emphasized the importance of fostering critical thinking and discernment in AI's application, particularly in the realm of artistic and cultural production.</p>
<p>Greer, however, expressed skepticism about AI's ability to enhance academic productivity. He argued that the neoliberal university's emphasis on metrics and quantification has led to a culture of mediocrity and superficiality, where AI might exacerbate these issues.</p>
<h3 id="the-threat-of-bullshit-jobs-and-the-commodification-of-knowledge">The Threat of Bullshit Jobs and the Commodification of Knowledge</h3>
<p>Greer raised concerns about the emergence of "bullshit jobs" – tasks that are unnecessary or meaningless but have been created to keep workers employed. He argued that AI could exacerbate this phenomenon by automating low-skilled tasks, leading to a loss of jobs and increased inequality.</p>
<p>Boan agreed, noting that the commodification of knowledge and the marketization of higher education pose significant challenges to the university's mission. She argued that the neoliberal university's focus on profitability and marketability has led to a decline in the quality of education and research.</p>
<p>Cooper, however, remained optimistic about AI's potential to disrupt existing power dynamics within academia. He cited examples of AI-powered tools that enable researchers to process vast amounts of data and uncover hidden patterns, potentially challenging established narratives and paradigms.</p>
<h3 id="ai-and-the-future-of-education">AI and the Future of Education</h3>
<p>The panelists agreed that AI presents both opportunities and threats to education. Greer argued that AI could help personalize learning experiences, tailoring educational content to individual students' needs and preferences. However, he cautioned that this could also lead to a loss of shared public space and a fragmentation of educational experiences.</p>
<p>Boan emphasized the importance of fostering critical thinking and discernment in AI's application. She argued that AI should be used to augment human intelligence, rather than replace it. Cooper agreed, noting that AI should be seen as a tool for enhancing education, rather than a panacea for its ills.</p>
<h3 id="the-need-for-ethical-discernment-and-critical-thinking">The Need for Ethical Discernment and Critical Thinking</h3>
<p>Throughout the discussion, the panelists emphasized the importance of ethical discernment and critical thinking in AI's application. They argued that AI should be used to augment human intelligence and foster democratic values, rather than replace them.</p>
<p>Hayward, in her response to the panel, echoed these sentiments. She called for a more nuanced and critical approach to AI, noting that AI is not a neutral tool but a reflection of the values and biases of its creators. She argued that academia has a crucial role to play in fostering critical thinking and ethical discernment in AI's application.</p>
<h2 id="qa-session">Q&amp;A Session</h2>
<p>The symposium concluded with a Q&amp;A session, during which audience members raised several key questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>How can we distinguish between AI-generated and human-written text?</strong>: Hayward acknowledged the challenge of distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written text, noting that AI has become increasingly sophisticated in mimicking human language. She argued that the focus should be on fostering critical thinking and discernment, rather than on developing technical solutions to detect AI-generated content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What role does AI play in the commodification of knowledge and the marketization of higher education?</strong>: Greer argued that AI is both a symptom and a cause of the commodification of knowledge. He noted that AI can be used to automate the production of low-quality, standardized educational content, further undermining the university's mission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How can we prevent AI from exacerbating existing biases and inequalities?</strong>: Cooper emphasized the importance of diversity and inclusivity in AI development and deployment. He argued that AI systems should be designed to mitigate biases and that their performance should be regularly audited to ensure fairness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What are the ethical implications of AI's autonomous nature?</strong>: Boan noted that AI's autonomous nature raises questions about accountability and responsibility. She argued that AI systems should be designed with transparency and explainability in mind, enabling users to understand and challenge their decisions.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="the-rise-of-cultural-violence-and-the-fight-for-urban-space-a-case-study-of-neosa-street">The Rise of Cultural Violence and the Fight for Urban Space: A Case Study of Neosa Street</h1>
<p>The Futures Annual Symposium of 2024 brought together a panel of experts to discuss the growing influence of cultural violence and the struggle for urban space, using the case study of Neosa Street in Belgrade, Serbia. The panel included Vladimir Arsić, a prolific writer and cultural worker, and Zoran Nevešević, a researcher at the Institute for Democracy 'Societas Civilis', focusing on EU enlargement and Europeanization in the Balkans. The session was moderated by Iana Dichenko, a journalist and editor at N1, a CNN affiliate in Southeastern Europe.</p>
<h2 id="the-state-of-neosa-street">The State of Neosa Street</h2>
<p>Vladimir Arsić opened the session by describing the current state of Neosa Street, a central street in Belgrade that has become a battleground for differing ideologies. The street is lined with linden trees and is typically quiet and walkable, but it has become a canvas for far-right propaganda, with murals and graffiti glorifying war criminals and promoting anti-European and anti-liberal sentiments. Arsić noted that the street has become a symbol of the growing influence of cultural violence in Serbia, with far-right groups using it to spread their message and intimidate those who disagree with them.</p>
<h2 id="the-far-right-presence-on-neosa-street">The Far-Right Presence on Neosa Street</h2>
<p>Arsić detailed the far-right presence on Neosa Street, which includes murals and graffiti glorifying Ratko Mladić, a war criminal accused of genocide, and promoting the remilitarization of Kosovo. He noted that the far-right groups behind these messages are also responsible for acts of violence, including the murder of a 13-year-old boy who opened fire on his school, killing seven students and a guard. Arsić also discussed the connection between the far-right groups and the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), noting that many of the groups' leaders are SNS members or supporters.</p>
<h2 id="the-response-to-cultural-violence-on-neosa-street">The Response to Cultural Violence on Neosa Street</h2>
<p>Arsić described the various responses to the cultural violence on Neosa Street. The Association 'Crocodile', which he heads, has been working to remove toxic murals and graffiti from the street, and to create a platform for writers and artists from different countries to meet and read their work. Arsić also discussed the role of the police, noting that while some officers have been supportive of their efforts, others have been complicit in the far-right groups' activities.</p>
<p>Zoran Nevešević discussed the role of the state in the spread of cultural violence, noting that the Serbian government has been complicit in the far-right groups' activities. He argued that the state has failed to condemn the violence and has even provided a platform for far-right groups to spread their message. Nevešević also discussed the role of the media, noting that some media outlets have been complicit in the spread of cultural violence, while others have provided a platform for counter-narratives.</p>
<h2 id="the-fight-for-urban-space">The Fight for Urban Space</h2>
<p>The panelists discussed the fight for urban space on Neosa Street and the importance of reclaiming public spaces from far-right groups. Arsić noted that the Association 'Crocodile' has been working to create a counter-narrative to the far-right groups' message, by organizing cultural events and creating murals that promote a more inclusive and democratic society. Nevešević discussed the importance of memorialization and the need to challenge the dominant narratives promoted by far-right groups.</p>
<h2 id="the-way-forward">The Way Forward</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the panelists discussed the way forward in the fight against cultural violence on Neosa Street. Arsić noted that the Association 'Crocodile' has been working to create a counter-narrative to the far-right groups' message, by organizing cultural events and creating murals that promote a more inclusive and democratic society. Nevešević discussed the importance of memorialization and the need to challenge the dominant narratives promoted by far-right groups. He also noted that the fight against cultural violence requires a collective effort, involving not just activists and cultural workers, but also the state and the media.</p>
<p>The session ended with a Q&amp;A, during which the panelists answered questions from the audience. The panelists emphasized the importance of collective effort in the fight against cultural violence, and the need to reclaim urban space from far-right groups.</p>
<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p>The panel discussion on the rise of cultural violence and the fight for urban space on Neosa Street provided valuable insights into the ongoing struggle against far-right groups in Serbia. The case study of Neosa Street highlighted the importance of reclaiming public spaces and challenging dominant narratives promoted by far-right groups. The panelists' discussions of the role of the state, the media, and civil society in the fight against cultural violence also provided valuable insights into the ways in which cultural violence can be challenged and resisted.</p>
<p>However, the panel discussion also raised important questions about the ways in which cultural violence can be challenged and resisted. For example, while the panelists emphasized the importance of collective effort in the fight against cultural violence, it is not clear how such collective effort can be sustained in the face of a hostile state and a complicit media. Additionally, while the panelists discussed the importance of memorialization and challenging dominant narratives, it is not clear how such efforts can be effective in the face of a far-right groups that are increasingly willing to use violence to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the panel discussion on the rise of cultural violence and the fight for urban space on Neosa Street provided valuable insights into the ongoing struggle against far-right groups in Serbia. However, the panel discussion also raised important questions about the ways in which cultural violence can be challenged and resisted, and the need for a more sustained and collective effort in the fight against cultural violence.</p>

<h1 id="futures-annual-symposium-2024-russia-a-historical-perspective">Futures Annual Symposium 2024: Russia - A Historical Perspective</h1>
<p>The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 kicked off with a panel discussion on Russia, moderated by Tom Deval, a journalist from Kiwi Europe. The panelists included Kadri, a Russian historian and Fellow of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), and Gregorio Mikov, a director at the Diit Bet think tank. The discussion was titled "Russia: A Historical Perspective," and it explored the historical context and potential future trajectory of Russia.</p>
<h2 id="the-perestroika-era-a-historical-mistake">The Perestroika Era: A Historical Mistake?</h2>
<p>Tom Deval began the discussion by reflecting on his own experiences in Russia, from his first visit in 1987 to the present day. He noted that Russia had always defied his expectations, and he was skeptical about the idea that Russia would proceed along a straight, linear path in the future. He introduced Kadri, who had chosen the topic of "The Perestroika Era: A Historical Mistake?" for his fellowship at the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>Kadri started by recounting the rapid and unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union. He noted that the March 1991 coup attempt against Mikhail Gorbachev had failed without resistance, and that Boris Yeltsin had taken control of the country just a month later. This sudden collapse had shattered the illusion of stability under the Soviet Union, and Kadri argued that Russia's future would not follow a linear path. He reflected on his experiences in Russia during the perestroika era, noting that Russia often did not behave as he expected and that his "internal compass" had been formed by his experiences in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Kadri argued that the perestroika era had been a time of fluidity and change, where rules could change from day to day. He noted that the Soviet Union had allowed a certain degree of freedom, with poets able to refuse censorship and even join the Communist Youth League to avoid it. He remembered refusing to wear a school uniform and not being penalized, and he recalled the sense of hope and optimism that had permeated Russian society at the time. However, he also noted that many Russians had sensed the impending collapse of the Soviet Union and had felt a sense of ambivalence about the future.</p>
<p>Kadri reflected on his experiences in Russia during the 1990s, when he had witnessed both the thrill and the violence of the period. He noted that Russia was not a linear society, and that he did not expect Russia's future to follow a straight path. He argued that Russia's future would be determined by its historical trajectory, and that understanding the perestroika era was key to understanding Russia's future.</p>
<h2 id="russias-historical-trajectory">Russia's Historical Trajectory</h2>
<p>Tom Deval asked Kadri about Russia's historical trajectory, and Kadri argued that Russia had always been a cyclical society, with competition between the state and society being a constant theme. He noted that Russia had always been a state that sought to suppress dissent and that this tendency had been present throughout Russian history. He argued that Russia's future would be determined by the same forces that had shaped its past.</p>
<p>Gregorio Mikov, the director at Diit Bet, agreed with Kadri's assessment. He argued that Russia's future would not follow a linear path, and that the country would continue to oscillate between periods of reform and periods of repression. He noted that Russia had always been a cyclical society, with periods of autocracy and periods of democratic reform. He argued that Russia's future would be determined by the same historical forces that had shaped its past.</p>
<p>Tom Deval asked the panelists about the role of ideology in Russia's historical trajectory. Kadri argued that ideology had played a crucial role in shaping Russia's past, and that it would continue to do so in the future. He noted that Russia had always been a state that had sought to impose its ideology on its citizens, and that this tendency had been present throughout Russian history. He argued that Russia's future would be determined by the same ideological forces that had shaped its past.</p>
<p>Gregorio Mikov agreed with Kadri's assessment, noting that ideology had played a crucial role in shaping Russia's past. He argued that Russia had always been a state that had sought to impose its ideology on its citizens, and that this tendency had been present throughout Russian history. He noted that Russia had always been a state that had sought to control its citizens, and that this tendency had been present throughout Russian history. He argued that Russia's future would be determined by the same ideological and political forces that had shaped its past.</p>
<h2 id="the-perestroika-era-a-missed-opportunity">The Perestroika Era: A Missed Opportunity?</h2>
<p>Tom Deval asked the panelists about the perestroika era, and whether it had been a missed opportunity for democratic reform in Russia. Kadri argued that the perestroika era had been a time of immense potential, but that it had ultimately been a missed opportunity. He noted that the Soviet Union had been on the brink of collapse in 1991, and that the country had been ripe for democratic reform. However, he argued that the Soviet Union had ultimately failed to take advantage of this opportunity, and that Russia had missed its chance to become a democratic society.</p>
<p>Gregorio Mikov agreed with Kadri's assessment, noting that the perestroika era had been a time of immense potential for democratic reform in Russia. He argued that the Soviet Union had been on the brink of collapse in 1991, and that Russia had been on the cusp of a democratic transition. However, he noted that Russia had ultimately failed to take advantage of this opportunity, and that the country had missed its chance to become a democratic society. He argued that Russia's future would be determined by the same historical forces that had shaped its past, and that the country would continue to oscillate between periods of reform and periods of repression.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-the-west-in-russias-historical-trajectory">The Role of the West in Russia's Historical Trajectory</h2>
<p>Tom Deval asked the panelists about the role of the West in Russia's historical trajectory. Kadri argued that the West had played a crucial role in shaping Russia's past, and that it would continue to do so in the future. He noted that the West had supported Gorbachev and Yeltsin in their efforts to reform the Soviet Union, and that it had played a crucial role in the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, he argued that the West had ultimately failed to support Russia's democratic transition, and that it had missed an opportunity to help Russia become a democratic society.</p>
<p>Gregorio Mikov agreed with Kadri's assessment, noting that the West had played a crucial role in shaping Russia's past.

He argued that Russia's future would be determined by the same historical forces that had shaped its past, and that the West would continue to play a crucial role in shaping Russia's future.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-russia-a-historical-perspective">The Future of Russia: A Historical Perspective</h2>
<p>Tom Deval asked the panelists about their predictions for Russia's future. Kadri argued that Russia's future would not follow a linear path, and that the country would continue to oscillate between periods of reform and periods of repression. He noted that Russia had always been a cyclical society, and that this tendency would continue to shape the country's future. He argued that Russia's future would be determined by the same historical forces that had shaped its past, and that the country would continue to be shaped by the same ideological and political forces that had always been present in Russian society.</p>

<h2 id="the-role-of-history-in-understanding-russias-future">The Role of History in Understanding Russia's Future</h2>
<p>Tom Deval asked the panelists about the role of history in understanding Russia's future. Kadri argued that history was crucial to understanding Russia's future, and that understanding Russia's past was key to understanding its future trajectory. He noted that Russia had always been a cyclical society, and that understanding the country's historical trajectory was essential to understanding its future. He argued that Russia's future would be determined by the same historical forces that had shaped its past, and that understanding these forces was crucial to understanding Russia's future.</p>

<h1 id="futures-annual-symposium-2024-the-rise-of-far-right-populism-in-europe-and-its-impact-on-democracy">Futures Annual Symposium 2024: The Rise of Far-Right Populism in Europe and its Impact on Democracy</h1>
<p>The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 convened prominent scholars, political analysts, and activists to discuss the pressing issue of the rise of far-right populism in Europe and its implications for democracy. The following chapter presents a detailed transcription of the event's keynote panel, "The Far-Right Turn in Slovakia: A Case Study," followed by a lively Q&amp;A session. The discussion offers valuable insights into the complex dynamics of far-right populism, the polarization of societies, and the challenges faced by democratic institutions in the face of authoritarian tendencies.</p>
<h2 id="keynote-panel-the-far-right-turn-in-slovakia-a-case-study">Keynote Panel: The Far-Right Turn in Slovakia: A Case Study</h2>
<h3 id="introduction_1">Introduction</h3>
<p><strong>Kolina Viura</strong> (Moderator): Good morning, unfortunately, Kolina Viura cannot be with us today due to unforeseen family reasons. I'm sure you all join me in wishing her the best. I'm [Moderator's Name], and I'll be stepping in to introduce our distinguished panelists. We have with us Alida Raic, Peter Kco, and Gia M. Nikov, who will be discussing the recent political developments in Slovakia and their implications for the broader European context. Let's begin.</p>
<h3 id="the-assassination-attempt-and-its-aftermath">The Assassination Attempt and Its Aftermath</h3>
<p><strong>Gia M. Nikov</strong>: Thank you for having us. I'd like to start by offering our sympathies to Slovakia and the family of the Prime Minister, Robert Fico, who was recently the target of an assassination attempt. We wish him a speedy recovery. Now, let's turn our attention to the political situation in Slovakia. The attempted assassination of Prime Minister Fico has led to a new composition of the European Commission, with Slovakia looking towards the upcoming Council election results. The assassination attempt has also reignited debates about the far-right turn in Slovakia and the polarization of its society.</p>
<p>The attempted assassination of Robert Fico serves as a stark reminder of the deep-seated divisions within Slovak society. The ruling coalition has blamed the opposition for the attack, while the opposition has, in turn, accused the government of using the incident to distract from its own incompetence and corruption. This blame game has further fueled the political polarization in Slovakia, with both sides digging in their heels and refusing to engage in meaningful dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Kco</strong>: I'd like to add that the assassination attempt has also led to a power struggle within the ruling coalition. Vice-Prime Minister Robert Kaliňák has been fulfilling the duties of the Prime Minister, but the government has not yet entrusted him with the full legal replacement. The political situation in Slovakia remains unstable, with the ruling coalition blaming the opposition for the assassination attempt, while the opposition accuses the government of incompetence and corruption.</p>
<h3 id="the-far-right-turn-in-slovakia">The Far-Right Turn in Slovakia</h3>
<p><strong>Gia M. Nikov</strong>: The assassination attempt and its aftermath have brought to the fore the issue of the far-right turn in Slovakia. Far-right populist parties have been gaining traction in Slovakia, as they have elsewhere in Europe. The ruling coalition, led by the SMER-SD party, has been accused of pandering to far-right sentiments and policies to maintain its grip on power.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Kco</strong>: It is important to note that the far-right turn in Slovakia is part of a broader trend in Central Europe. Far-right populist parties have been gaining ground in countries such as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. These parties share a similar ideology, which combines nationalism, xenophobia, and Euroscepticism. They also tend to be critical of liberal democratic values and institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Gia M. Nikov</strong>: To understand the far-right turn in Slovakia, it is necessary to examine the political landscape and the cleavages within Slovak society. The country is divided between two main political camps: the national populist camp, represented by SMER-SD and the Slovak National Party (SNS), and the liberal democratic camp, represented by parties such as the Progressive Slovakia (PS), the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), and the Hungarian minority party, Most-Híd. The far-right SNS has been a member of the ruling coalition since 2016, and its influence has grown significantly since then.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Kco</strong>: The assassination attempt on Robert Fico has also brought to light the role of the far-right paramilitary organization, GIBR, which has been linked to the main suspect in the assassination attempt, Marian Kuchner. GIBR has been described as a neo-Nazi organization, and its members have been involved in several violent incidents in Slovakia. The organization has also been linked to the far-right party, LSNS, which has gained ground in recent years.</p>
<p><strong>Gia M. Nikov</strong>: The rise of the far-right in Slovakia can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the economic crisis of 2008-2009 led to a shift in the political landscape, with traditional parties losing support and new, more radical parties gaining ground. Secondly, the migration crisis of 2015-2016 further fueled far-right sentiments, with parties such as LSNS gaining significant support by exploiting anti-immigrant and anti-EU sentiments. Lastly, the ruling coalition has been accused of using divisive rhetoric and policies to maintain its grip on power, further polarizing society and fueling far-right sentiments.</p>
<h3 id="the-assassination-attempt-and-the-polarization-of-slovak-society">The Assassination Attempt and the Polarization of Slovak Society</h3>
<p><strong>Alida Raic</strong>: The assassination attempt on Robert Fico has exacerbated the polarization of Slovak society. Polls conducted after the incident show that a majority of Slovaks blame the opposition for the attack, while a significant minority blames the government. This division is reflective of the deeper cleavages within Slovak society, which have been exacerbated by the ruling coalition's populist rhetoric and policies.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Kco</strong>: The polarization of Slovak society has also been fueled by the ruling coalition's attempts to dismantle the liberal democratic regime in Slovakia. The coalition has been accused of using divisive rhetoric and policies to consolidate power and suppress dissent. For example, the coalition has introduced legislation that would restrict the independence of the media and the judiciary, and it has used state resources to support pro-government media outlets.</p>
<p><strong>Gia M. Nikov</strong>: The assassination attempt has also brought to light the role of the media in fueling the polarization of Slovak society. State-owned media outlets have been accused of using biased and divisive reporting to support the ruling coalition, while independent media outlets have been subject to harassment and intimidation. The assassination attempt has also highlighted the importance of investigative journalism in holding power to account, with journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, being murdered in 2018 for their investigative work.</p>
<h3 id="the-european-context">The European Context</h3>
<p><strong>Alida Raic</strong>: The rise of far-right populism in Slovakia is part of a broader trend in Europe. Far-right populist parties have been gaining ground in countries such as France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. These parties share a similar ideology, which combines nationalism, xenophobia, and Euroscepticism. They also tend to be critical of liberal democratic values and institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Kco</strong>: The far-right turn in Europe has been facilitated by several factors, including the economic crisis of 2008-2009, the migration crisis of 2015-2016, and the failure of traditional political parties to address the concerns of ordinary people. Far-right populist parties have been successful in exploiting these issues to gain support and challenge the status quo.</p>
<p><strong>Gia M. Nikov</strong>: The rise of far-right populism in Europe poses a significant threat to liberal democratic values and institutions. Far-right populist parties tend to be critical of liberal democratic norms, such as freedom of speech, the independence of the judiciary, and the rule of law. They also tend to be hostile to immigration and multiculturalism, and they often promote divisive and exclusionary policies.</p>
<h3 id="qa-session_1">Q&amp;A Session</h3>
<p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Thank you for your insights, panelists. Let's open the floor to questions from the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Audience Member 1</strong>: Thank you for the comprehensive overview of the situation in Slovakia. I have a question about the European context. How do you think the rise of far-right populism will impact the upcoming European Parliament elections?</p>
<p><strong>Alida Raic</strong>: Thank you for your question. I think the rise of far-right populism will have a significant impact on the upcoming European Parliament elections. Far-right populist parties are expected to gain ground in several countries, including France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. This could lead to a more Eurosceptic and nationalist European Parliament, which could challenge the status quo and the liberal democratic values that underpin the European project.</p>
<p><strong>Audience Member 2</strong>: I'd like to ask a question about the role of the media in fueling the polarization of Slovak society. How can we promote independent and unbiased reporting in Slovakia, and what can be done to protect investigative journalists?</p>
<p><strong>Peter Kco</strong>: Thank you for your question. Promoting independent and unbiased reporting in Slovakia requires a multifaceted approach. Firstly, it is important to strengthen the independence of public media outlets and ensure that they adhere to professional standards of journalism. Secondly, it is crucial to support independent media outlets and investigative journalists, for example, through public funding and legal protections. Lastly, it is essential to address the harassment and intimidation of investigative journalists, for example, by investigating and prosecuting those responsible for threats and violence against journalists.</p>
<p><strong>Audience Member 3</strong>: Thank you for your panel. I have a question about the role of civil society in challenging the far-right turn in Slovakia. How can civil society organizations promote liberal democratic values and hold power to account?</p>
<p><strong>Gia M. Nikov</strong>: Thank you for your question. Civil society organizations play a crucial role in challenging the far-right turn in Slovakia and promoting liberal democratic values. They can do this by advocating for the independence of the media and the judiciary, promoting inclusive and tolerant policies, and holding power to account through investigative journalism and advocacy. Civil society organizations can also work together to build coalitions and amplify their voices, for example, through alliances with international organizations and other democratic countries.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion_4">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The rise of far-right populism in Slovakia and elsewhere in Europe poses a significant threat to liberal democratic values and institutions. The assassination attempt on Robert Fico has brought to light the deep-seated divisions within Slovak society and the challenges faced by democratic institutions in the face of authoritarian tendencies. The panelists agreed that addressing the far-right turn in Slovakia requires a multifaceted approach, including strengthening the independence of the media and the judiciary, promoting inclusive and tolerant policies, and holding power to account through investigative journalism and advocacy. The panel also highlighted the importance of the European context, with the rise of far-right populism expected to impact the upcoming European Parliament elections.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-7-deliberative-democracy-in-action-the-role-of-citizen-assemblies-in-strengthening-democracy">Chapter 7: Deliberative Democracy in Action: The Role of Citizen Assemblies in Strengthening Democracy</h1>
<p>The Futures Annual Symposium of 2024 gathered an array of experts and practitioners to discuss the pressing challenges facing democracies worldwide, with a particular focus on the potential of citizen assemblies to address these issues. This chapter will delve into the key arguments presented during the second session of the symposium, titled "An Inclusive and Participatory Approach: Citizen Assemblies as a Bridge Across Divided Democratic Societies."</p>
<h2 id="the-case-for-citizen-assemblies-in-central-and-eastern-europe">The Case for Citizen Assemblies in Central and Eastern Europe</h2>
<p>The session kicked off with a presentation by <strong>Eglė Samuolytė</strong>, a representative from the organization Democracy Next, who argued for the benefits of citizen assemblies in addressing the authoritarian tendencies in Central and Eastern Europe. Samuolytė, born and raised in independent Lithuania, brought a unique perspective to the table, having witnessed firsthand the reshuffling of worldviews brought about by the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Samuolytė presented an argument built around the potential of citizen assemblies to help address internal power capture, foreign interference, and democratic erosion in the region. She compared the benefits of citizen assemblies to those of traditional consultation methods, highlighting the deliberative nature of the former and the depth of participation they encourage.</p>
<h3 id="building-resilient-democracies-through-citizen-assemblies">Building Resilient Democracies through Citizen Assemblies</h3>
<p>Samuolytė argued that citizen assemblies can serve as a tool to build resilient democracies, opening avenues for citizen participation and demonstrating the value of citizen input in decision-making processes. She believed that the strategic use of citizen assemblies could help prevent the hijacking of the democratic process by populist forces.</p>
<p>To illustrate her point, Samuolytė mentioned the example of Hungary, where citizen assemblies at the local level could serve as bastions of democracy, even as national politics played out differently. She emphasized the importance of building capacity and trust at the local level, creating a reservoir of democratic resilience that could help counter dystopian scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="the-potential-of-citizen-assemblies-in-reducing-misinformation">The Potential of Citizen Assemblies in Reducing Misinformation</h3>
<p>Samuolytė also discussed the potential of citizen assemblies in reducing misinformation and disinformation. She cited the example of the French citizen assembly on abortion, which raised the quality of public debate and led to a change in the agenda, ultimately resulting in a referendum that allowed for more permissive abortion laws in Ireland.</p>
<p>Samuolytė analyzed the growing wave of citizen assemblies in Central and Eastern Europe, noting that since 2016, 37 assemblies had taken place in the region. She highlighted the innovative approaches taken by countries like Poland and Hungary, which had implemented assemblies at the local level before moving to the national stage.</p>
<h3 id="the-need-for-context-specific-innovations">The Need for Context-Specific Innovations</h3>
<p>While Samuolytė presented a compelling case for the benefits of citizen assemblies, she also acknowledged the need for context-specific innovations. She noted that existing instruments for reaching citizens, such as MPs, political parties, and civil society organizations, already serve valuable purposes. However, she argued that citizen assemblies could provide an additional tool for addressing complex, emotionally charged issues that require a depth of deliberation and expertise.</p>
<p>Samuolytė concluded her presentation by emphasizing the importance of learning from one another and sharing best practices to ensure that citizen assemblies are implemented effectively. She stressed the need for international collaboration and the provision of resources to enable assemblies to take place and achieve meaningful impact.</p>
<h2 id="the-debate-benefits-and-challenges-of-citizen-assemblies">The Debate: Benefits and Challenges of Citizen Assemblies</h2>
<p>Following Samuolytė's presentation, the floor was opened for debate. <strong>Anastasija Samoylova</strong> (not to be confused with Eglė Samuolytė) kicked off the discussion by questioning the overemphasis on citizen assemblies as a panacea for democratic ills. She argued that citizen assemblies should not be seen as a replacement for existing democratic institutions but rather as a complement to them.</p>
<p><strong>Kristóf Szombati</strong> countered Samoylova's skepticism, presenting a devil's advocate perspective. He argued that the representation gap in democracies today is too great to be addressed by existing institutions alone. He believed that citizen assemblies could provide a much-needed corrective to the representational deficits in contemporary democracies.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Grabbe</strong> chimed in, arguing that while citizen assemblies can provide valuable input into decision-making processes, they are not a cure-all for democratic challenges. She noted that there is a risk of populism hijacking the deliberative process, particularly in dystopian scenarios. Grabbe emphasized the importance of ensuring that assemblies are run in a transparent and impartial manner, with clear guidelines for decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Alberto Mazzola</strong> echoed Grabbe's concerns, noting that populist forces could co-opt assemblies and use them to legitimize their agendas. He argued that assemblies should be designed in a way that encourages cross-partisan support and ensures that recommendations are taken forward.</p>
<p><strong>Edgaras Šileikis</strong> agreed with Mazzola, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that assemblies are not hijacked by populist forces. He argued that assemblies should be designed in a way that ensures their recommendations are taken seriously by policymakers.</p>
<p><strong>Anna Herzegh</strong> raised concerns about the potential for populist forces to manipulate assemblies for their own ends, noting that there is a risk that assemblies could be used to legitimize populist agendas. She argued that assemblies should be designed in a way that encourages informed deliberation and discourages populist manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>Béla Kádár</strong> agreed with Herzegh, noting that assemblies should be designed in a way that ensures that they are not co-opted by populist forces. He argued that assemblies should be seen as an addition to existing democratic institutions, rather than a replacement for them.</p>
<h3 id="the-relationship-between-deliberative-democracy-and-populism">The Relationship between Deliberative Democracy and Populism</h3>
<p>The debate then turned to the relationship between deliberative democracy and populism. <strong>Heather Grabbe</strong> argued that populism is a response to the representational deficits in contemporary democracies. She believed that assemblies could provide a means of addressing these deficits and countering populist forces.</p>
<p><strong>Alberto Mazzola</strong> countered that assemblies could be manipulated by populist forces to further their agendas. He argued that assemblies should be designed in a way that ensures that they are not co-opted by populist forces.</p>
<p><strong>Edgaras Šileikis</strong> agreed with Mazzola, noting that assemblies should be designed in a way that ensures that their recommendations are taken seriously by policymakers. He argued that assemblies should be seen as an addition to existing democratic institutions, rather than a replacement for them.</p>
<p><strong>Anna Herzegh</strong> raised concerns about the potential for assemblies to be manipulated by populist forces, noting that assemblies should be designed in a way that ensures that they are not co-opted by populist agendas. She argued that assemblies should be seen as a means of encouraging informed deliberation and countering populism.</p>
<p><strong>Béla Kádár</strong> agreed with Herzegh, noting that assemblies should be seen as an addition to existing democratic institutions, rather than a replacement for them. He argued that assemblies should be designed in a way that ensures that they are not co-opted by populist forces.</p>
<h3 id="the-role-of-expertise-in-deliberative-democracy">The Role of Expertise in Deliberative Democracy</h3>
<p>The debate then turned to the role of expertise in deliberative democracy. <strong>Heather Grabbe</strong> argued that assemblies should be designed in a way that encourages informed deliberation, noting that citizens should be provided with evidence and expertise to inform their decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Alberto Mazzola</strong> countered that assemblies should not be seen as a replacement for existing institutions, noting that elected representatives have access to expertise and resources that assemblies may not have.</p>
<p><strong>Edgaras Šileikis</strong> agreed with Mazzola, noting that assemblies should be seen as an addition to existing democratic institutions, rather than a replacement for them. He argued that assemblies should be designed in a way that ensures that their recommendations are taken seriously by policymakers.</p>

<h3 id="the-relationship-between-deliberative-democracy-and-representative-democracy">The Relationship Between Deliberative Democracy and Representative Democracy</h3>
<p>The debate concluded by exploring the relationship between deliberative democracy and representative democracy. <strong>Heather Grabbe</strong> argued that assemblies should be seen as a complement to existing democratic institutions, rather than a replacement for them. She noted that assemblies can provide valuable input into decision-making processes but should not be seen as a panacea for democratic ills.</p>
<p><strong>Alberto Mazzola</strong> agreed with Grabbe, noting that assemblies should be designed in a way that ensures that they are not co-opted by populist forces. He argued that assemblies should be seen as an addition to existing democratic institutions, rather than a replacement for them.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion_5">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Futures Annual Symposium of 2024 brought together a diverse range of experts and practitioners to discuss the potential of citizen assemblies in addressing the challenges facing democracies worldwide. The session on "An Inclusive and Participatory Approach: Citizen Assemblies as a Bridge Across Divided Democratic Societies" highlighted the benefits that assemblies can bring to democratic processes, including their potential to address representational deficits, encourage informed deliberation, and counter populist forces.</p>
<p>However, the debate also raised important concerns about the risks of assemblies being co-opted by populist forces and the need to design assemblies in a way that ensures their recommendations are taken seriously by policymakers. The symposium underscored the importance of learning from one another and sharing best practices to ensure that assemblies are implemented effectively and that they contribute to the strengthening of democratic processes worldwide.</p>
<p>As the symposium concluded, it was clear that the potential of citizen assemblies to address the challenges facing democracies today is significant. However, it is equally clear that assemblies should not be seen as a panacea for democratic ills but rather as a complement to existing democratic institutions. By working together to design and implement assemblies effectively, democratic societies can harness the power of deliberative democracy to address the pressing challenges of our time.</p>

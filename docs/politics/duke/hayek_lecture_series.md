## "The Captured Economy" Steven Teles, Hayek Lecture Series

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iCvZRs8udQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iCvZRs8udQ)

 In his lecture, Steven Teles discusses the concept of the "captured economy," where the economy is dominated by rent-seeking behavior and political influence. Key points from the lecture include:

- The increasing influence of organized interests in politics, which often protect the status quo and maintain the wealth and power of specific groups.
- The role of intellectual property protection and regulation in creating pervasive barriers to entry and concentrated wealth in industries like entertainment, finance, and real estate.
- The idea that the deregulatory era, often labeled as neoliberalism, has led to an increase in regulation, particularly in the form of intellectual property protection and licensing.
- The notion that many industries, such as healthcare, education, and finance, are characterized by organized interests that use regulation to create barriers to entry and maintain market share.
- The argument that rent-seeking behavior is driven by political organizations that benefit from the preservation of existing systems, rather than by creative destruction or market competition.
- The idea that effective deliberation and information sharing can counteract rent-seeking behavior and lead to better policy outcomes.
- The suggestion that subsidies and countervailing power can help balance the influence of organized interests and promote competition.

Teles argues that the capture of the economy by rent-seeking behavior and political influence is a significant issue that needs to be addressed through deliberation, increased transparency, and reforming the political system to reduce the power of organized interests.

 - Transaction cost theory:
  - Voluntary exchange is the basis of a better public policy and a more efficient allocation of resources.
  - High transaction costs prevent many beneficial voluntary exchanges from taking place.
  - Transaction costs are similar to friction in a physical system, affecting the ease of movement and interaction.
- Commodification and the sharing economy:
  - Commodification of excess capacity can create value by allowing people to rent out unused resources, such as cars or apartments.
  - Examples include Airbnb and Uber, which reduce transaction costs by providing platforms for efficient matching and exchange.
  - The sharing economy enables people to share excess capacity, reducing waste and making use of resources that would otherwise remain idle.
- Software and permissionless innovation:
  - Software can reduce transaction costs by automating processes and connecting people more efficiently.
  - Permissionless innovation allows for the development of new services without needing permission from regulators or other gatekeepers.
  - The growth of the software industry has led to the commodification of services, such as ride-sharing and accommodation rentals.
- The impact of technology on the job market:
  - Automation and software services can replace human labor, reducing the demand for certain jobs and potentially increasing the opportunity cost of human work.
  - However, technology can also create new opportunities for specialized skills and services, such as the gig economy.
  - The sharing economy and platform businesses like Amazon and Uber are transforming industries and creating new ways of managing resources and exchanging goods and services.
- The future of work and the economy:
  - As technology continues to advance, it may lead to a shift in the balance between human labor and automation, potentially redefining the nature of work and the job market.

## "Why hasn't economic progress lowered work hours more?" Tyler Cowen, Hayek Lecture Series

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pk654J8-5c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pk654J8-5c)

 - The transcript is a discussion on the history of working hours, economic progress, and the impact of technological advancements on labor.
- Keynes' prediction in 1930 that with the advance of automation and technology, people would work fewer hours, enjoying more leisure time, and living in an enriched life with less work.
- The speaker highlights data showing that despite advancements in technology, the average working hours have not decreased significantly, and in some cases, have even increased for some groups.
- The discussion covers various factors influencing working hours, including the substitution effect (where people work more if they are paid more), income effect (people work less if they have higher income), and the role of social security and government benefits.
- The speaker discusses differences in working hours across gender, age, and socioeconomic groups, and the impact of education, lottery winnings, and other social factors on people's willingness to work or take vacation.
- The speaker acknowledges that there may be a correlation between the rise of modern technology and the expectation of higher wages, leading to an increase in working hours.
- The speaker suggests that the idea of a "rat race" may be an oversimplified explanation for the observed working patterns, and that the status competition hypothesis may not fully explain the cross-sectional variation in data.
- The speaker concludes by stating that while economic growth and technological advancements have not led to the reduction in working hours as initially predicted, it's important to continue examining the reasons behind these trends and considering the potential impact of future developments.

In summary, the transcript discusses the historical expectation of reduced working hours with increased technological advancements, and the reality of working patterns today, considering various factors such as income, social security, and status competition. The speaker argues that the observed trends may not fully align with initial predictions, and that continued research is necessary to understand the complex relationship between technology, economic growth, and working hours.


## "Exploitation and the Psychology of Moral Judgment" Matt Zwolinski, Hayek Lecture Series

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4hOrZaJPHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4hOrZaJPHg)

 - Exploitation and the Psychology of Moral Judgment: Matt Zwolinski discusses the complexities of exploitation and how it intersects with moral judgment, focusing on sweatshop labor, price gouging, and neglect.
  - Sweatshops: Although exploitative in nature, they can sometimes provide better opportunities than available alternatives, creating a moral quandary.
  - Price gouging: During emergencies, businesses may charge significantly higher prices for essential goods, taking advantage of desperate customers. This can be seen as exploitative but may also be a necessary response to meet increased demand.
  - Neglect: Ignoring people's suffering, especially in vulnerable situations, can be considered morally worse than exploitation because it actively harms individuals without providing any benefit.
  - Exploitation vs. Neglect: Exploitation may be more morally permissible when it offers some benefit to the exploited party, while neglect is often seen as morally wrong due to the harm it causes without any compensating advantage.
  - Moral psychology: Exploitation and neglect may evoke strong emotional responses, influencing moral judgments and potentially leading to biases in interpreting the situation.
  - The paradox of exploitation: Understanding the complexities of exploitation and neglect requires considering the context and consequences of each action, recognizing that moral judgments may not always be clear-cut.

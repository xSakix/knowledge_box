# Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024: Aart PK Memorial Lecture

## Introduction

The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium, held in 2024, was a special occasion, marked by the Aart PK Memorial Lecture, honoring the legacy of a mentor, friend, and instrumental figure in the establishment of the University of Regional and Advanced Study Center. The lecture was given by Wang Petri, a distinguished senior Austrian diplomat with a long and illustrious career, including serving as the International High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1997 to 1999, and as the Ambassador to Belgrade during the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999. Petri was also the Permanent Representative of Austria to the United Nations and the OECD in Geneva, and the President of the Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation. In this chapter, we delve into Petri's sweeping overview of the current geopolitical situation, titled "Contestation: A New Dynamic Driving Global Politics."

## A Personal Tribute to Aart PK

Petri began his lecture with a personal tribute to Aart PK, whom he described as someone with whom he had a conflict-free relationship based on mutual understanding and respect. He was particularly touched by a tour of the palace the previous day, where he saw PK's room, a sign of the man's enduring influence. Petri described PK as an inventor who played a crucial role in establishing the Institute for Human Sciences and served as its president for many years. He was a rare breed of public intellectual and practical politician, combining extraordinary parts of his life in a way that was seemingly impossible. Petri acknowledged that PK's personality, with its certain arrogance, also generated criticism, but it was this distinct feature that made him someone who could make things happen.

## The Geopolitical Landscape in 2024

Petri then turned his attention to the current geopolitical situation, highlighting several key developments:

### The End of Post-Cold War Optimism

Petri noted that the optimism of the post-Cold War era, when the world seemed to be moving towards a unipolar American order, had given way to a new reality. The implosion of Yugoslavia without violent conflict, the rise of China as a major power, and the resurgence of nationalism and populism across the globe had led to an era of contestation and competition.

### The Impact of Russia's Aggression in Ukraine

Russia's full-scale aggression in Ukraine, beginning in 2022, had irreversibly altered the nature of European integration. French President Emmanuel Macron had warned of the fragility of Europe's future, noting the threat posed by populism, nationalism, and the rise of illiberal democracies. Petri agreed, stating that the Russian aggression had brought the continent to the brink of another world war.

### The Rise of China and the Challenge to Western Dominance

Petri also highlighted the rise of China as a challenge to Western dominance. He noted that China's success in lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty had disproven the Western adage that democracy and capitalism go hand in hand. Instead, China's authoritarian model had proven to be an effective alternative, threatening the liberal democratic order.

### The Gap Between the Rich and the Poor

Petri also drew attention to the growing gap between the rich and the poor, both within and between nations. He noted that while technological progress had been breathtaking, it had also led to alarming levels of inequality and climate change.

### The Threat of Identitarian Nationalism

Petri also warned of the threat posed by identitarian nationalism, which was migrating from Europe to other parts of the world. He noted that majoritarian Hindu nationalism in India threatened the fabric of the country's pluralistic society, and that similar trends were evident in other parts of the world.

## Europe's Role in the Emerging Multipolar World

Petri then turned to the question of Europe's role in the emerging multipolar world. He noted that Europe was caught between the United States and China, both of which were preoccupied with their own interests. He argued that Europe needed to find a way to contribute to the new global order, rather than simply trying to balance the power of the major nations.

### The Need for a New Mental Map of the World

Petri argued that Europe needed to adopt a new mental map of the world, one that recognized the power of post-colonial politics and the need for global justice. He noted that the European Union's neighborhood policy had been inconsistent, with a double standard evident in its treatment of Ukraine compared to its treatment of other regions.

### The Need for Timely Policy Frameworks

Petri also emphasized the need for timely policy frameworks to address the challenges facing the world. He noted that the European Union had already taken steps to assert its leadership in the field of artificial intelligence, and that it needed to continue to do so in other areas.

## Conclusion

Petri concluded his lecture by invoking the spirit of Aart PK, urging the audience to take the task of navigating the uncharted waters of the future seriously. He noted that the Europe's Futures project was an important institutional arrangement for allowing Europeans to view the world fully cognizant of the enormity of the task ahead. He looked forward to the next steps in the project, and to the substantive discussions that would follow.

## Notes and References

Petri's lecture was part of the Europe's Futures Annual Symposium, held in 2024. The symposium was organized by the University of Regional and Advanced Study Center, which was established with the help of Aart PK, who was honored with a memorial lecture during the event. Petri's lecture was a sweeping overview of the current geopolitical situation, titled "Contestation: A New Dynamic Driving Global Politics." The lecture was marked by Petri's personal tribute to PK, his analysis of the geopolitical landscape in 2024, and his thoughts on Europe's role in the emerging multipolar world.

Petri's analysis of the geopolitical landscape was informed by several key developments, including the end of post-Cold War optimism, the impact of Russia's aggression in Ukraine, the rise of China as a challenge to Western dominance, the growing gap between the rich and the poor, and the threat of identitarian nationalism. He argued that Europe needed to find a way to contribute to the new global order, rather than simply trying to balance the power of the major nations. He noted that Europe needed to adopt a new mental map of the world, one that recognized the power of post-colonial politics and the need for global justice. He also emphasized the need for timely policy frameworks to address the challenges facing the world.

Petri's lecture was a call to action, urging Europeans to take seriously the task of navigating the uncharted waters of the future. He noted that the Europe's Futures project was an important institutional arrangement for allowing Europeans to view the world fully cognizant of the enormity of the task ahead. He looked forward to the next steps in the project, and to the substantive discussions that would follow.

In the following chapters, we will explore these themes in more detail, examining the implications of the geopolitical landscape in 2024 for Europe and the world. We will also consider the ways in which Europe can contribute to the new global order, and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

# Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024: Reimagining European Democracy

The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 convened a diverse range of experts, politicians, and activists to discuss the state of European integration and the path forward for the continent. The event was marked by a candid and wide-ranging exploration of the challenges and opportunities facing Europe, with a particular focus on the democratic deficit and the need for a more participatory and inclusive European project.

## The Permissive Consensus and the Democratic Deficit

The symposium opened with a keynote address by Alberto Alano, a prominent political scientist and long-time observer of European integration. Alano traced the history of European integration back to the 1990s, when the newly elected British Labour Government sought to rebrand itself as a 'Third Way' between social democracy and neoliberalism. This period saw a proliferation of new vocabulary around the European project, with terms like 'people's democracy' and 'people's Europe' becoming commonplace. However, Alano argued that this rhetoric was often decoupled from the reality of European integration, which remained a largely technocratic affair, driven by elite consensus rather than popular engagement.

Alano pointed to the example of Robin Cook, the newly appointed Foreign Secretary, who embarked on a tour of Central Europe in 1997, advocating for a 'People's Republic of Europe'. However, Alano noted that even Cook seemed unsure of what this meant in practice, and the idea was quickly forgotten. This, Alano suggested, was a symptom of a deeper problem: the democratic deficit at the heart of the European project.

Alano was not alone in his critique of the 'permissive consensus' that had long characterized European integration. Throughout the symposium, speakers and participants alike bemoaned the lack of popular engagement with the European project, and the inability of Europe's leaders to respond to the growing discontent of Europe's citizens.

## The Rise of Populism and the Backlash Against Technocracy

One of the most striking features of the symposium was the extent to which speakers and participants recognized the role that the democratic deficit had played in the rise of populism across Europe. As Rosa Balfour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Europe think tank, put it, 'The crisis of European democracy is not just a crisis of institutions, but a crisis of trust. And that trust has been eroded by years of technocratic decision-making, with little or no regard for the views of Europe's citizens.'

Balfour was echoed by many others, who pointed to the ways in which the European Union's focus on economic integration had come at the expense of democratic accountability. As one participant put it, 'We've built a single market, but we've forgotten to build a single democracy.'

The backlash against technocracy was a recurring theme throughout the symposium. Speakers and participants alike pointed to the ways in which Europe's leaders had failed to address the legitimate grievances of Europe's citizens, and had instead sought to impose solutions from above. As Nicolo Milanesi, the founder of the European Alternatives organization, put it, 'We need to stop thinking of Europe as a top-down project, and start thinking of it as a bottom-up one.'

## The Need for a More Participatory and Inclusive European Project

If there was one consensus that emerged from the symposium, it was the need for a more participatory and inclusive European project. Speakers and participants alike called for a renewed focus on democratic accountability, and for a European Union that was more responsive to the needs and concerns of its citizens.

One of the most intriguing proposals put forward was that of a European constituency, along the lines of the transnational lists that were briefly considered in the early 2000s. As Stefan Sander, a political scientist at the University of Vienna, put it, 'A European constituency would force every single National party to say, "What is our European political preference, and how do we articulate it to our constituency?"'

Sander was echoed by many others, who pointed to the ways in which a European constituency could help to break down the barriers between national politics and European politics. As one participant put it, 'We need to stop thinking of Europe as a separate project, and start thinking of it as a part of our everyday political lives.'

## The Challenge of Enlargement and the Need for Democratic Conditionality

One of the most contentious issues raised at the symposium was that of enlargement, and in particular, the question of whether to offer membership to countries like Turkey and Ukraine. While many speakers and participants were supportive of the principle of enlargement, there was also a recognition that the process had to be handled carefully, and that democratic conditionality had to be a key part of any enlargement strategy.

As Ian Bond, a former British diplomat and long-time advocate of enlargement, put it, 'We need to be clear about what we mean by enlargement, and about what kind of Europe we want to build. If we want a Europe that is more democratic, more inclusive, and more responsive to the needs of its citizens, then we have to be willing to put democratic conditionality at the heart of our enlargement policy.'

Bond was echoed by many others, who pointed to the ways in which the European Union had often failed to prioritize democratic values in its enlargement decisions. As one participant put it, 'We've often put economic integration ahead of democratic accountability, and that has to change.'

## The Path Forward for Europe's Democracy

As the symposium drew to a close, speakers and participants alike turned their attention to the question of what the path forward might look like for Europe's democracy. There was a widespread recognition that the challenges facing Europe were significant, and that there were no easy solutions. However, there was also a sense of optimism, and a belief that Europe's democracy could be renewed and reinvigorated.

One of the most striking proposals put forward was that of a 'Constitutional Convention', along the lines of the one that was held in France in the early 2000s. As Rosa Balfour put it, 'We need to bring Europe's citizens back into the European project, and we need to do that by giving them a say in the rules that govern it. A Constitutional Convention would be a powerful way to do that.'

Balfour was echoed by many others, who pointed to the ways in which a Constitutional Convention could help to build a more participatory and inclusive European project. As one participant put it, 'We need to stop thinking of Europe as a fait accompli, and start thinking of it as a project that we can all help to shape.'

## Conclusion

The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 was a remarkable event, marked by a candid and wide-ranging exploration of the challenges and opportunities facing Europe's democracy. Speakers and participants alike recognized the need for a more participatory and inclusive European project, and pointed to the ways in which Europe's leaders had often failed to prioritize democratic accountability.

If there was one consensus that emerged from the symposium, it was that Europe's democracy was at a crossroads, and that the path forward would require a renewed focus on democratic accountability, and on the need to build a Europe that was more responsive to the needs and concerns of its citizens. As Alberto Alano put it in his closing remarks, 'We stand at a moment of great opportunity, and great challenge. But if we are to build a Europe that is more democratic, more inclusive, and more responsive to the needs of its citizens, then we must be willing to think and act boldly. And we must be willing to do so together.'

# Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024: The Rise of Far-Right Politics and the Impact of the Russia-Ukraine War

The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 kicked off with a moderated session featuring Hannah Shelest, a right-wing politician and Russia-Ukraine War expert. The panel, which included Peter Balash, a political commentator, and Anna Hana, a researcher focusing on radicalization in the Western Balkans, discussed the rise of far-right politics in Europe and the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine War.

## The Russia-Ukraine War and Populism

Hannah began by discussing the Russian aggression towards Ukraine and how it has fueled populism and nationalism in Europe. She noted that the war has created a polarized society, with some supporting Ukraine and others, particularly in the far right, supporting Russia. Hannah presented research on radicalization trends in the Western Balkans, highlighting Serbia as a case study. She emphasized the importance of her research, given the upcoming European Parliament elections and the potential rise of far-right parties.

Peter Balash, a specialist in the political spectrum and conflict security, chimed in to discuss the influence of ideology and perception around conflicts. He argued that far-right parties often support Ukraine due to its fight for nationhood and sovereignty, aligning with their conservative and nationalist values. However, he also noted that anti-establishment and anti-imperialist sentiment within far-right parties can sometimes lead to pro-Russian sentiments, as Russia is often portrayed as a defender against Western imperialism.

Anna Hana then discussed the anti-European Union (EU) and anti-American sentiment within far-right parties, noting that these parties often view the EU and the United States as obstacles to their nationalist agendas. She argued that the Russia-Ukraine War has exacerbated these sentiments, leading to a more hostile political climate in Europe.

## The Role of Russian Influence and Disinformation

Balash brought up the role of Russian influence in the rise of far-right parties, citing the Russian government's support for extremist groups and political parties across Europe. He noted that Russia has actively supported far-right parties in countries such as Austria, Germany, and Italy, using disinformation campaigns to spread anti-EU and anti-NATO sentiment.

Hannah agreed, stating that Russia's support for far-right parties has been a successful information operation, helping to spread anti-Western sentiment and divide European societies. She emphasized the need for European countries to be more vigilant in detecting and countering Russian disinformation campaigns.

## The Impact of the Russia-Ukraine War on European Politics

The panel then discussed the impact of the Russia-Ukraine War on European politics, particularly the rise of far-right parties. Balash noted that the war has strengthened far-right parties in countries like Germany and the Netherlands, with some even aspiring to become prime ministers. He argued that the war has also led to a more aggressive and dangerous political climate, with far-right parties becoming more emboldened.

Hannah agreed, stating that the war has created a divisive political climate in Europe. She noted that far-right parties have capitalized on this division, using the war to rally support and spread anti-immigrant sentiment. She also argued that the war has created an opportunity for far-right parties to challenge mainstream parties and gain more political power.

## The Future of Far-Right Politics in Europe

The panel concluded by discussing the future of far-right politics in Europe. Balash argued that the rise of far-right parties is a long-term trend, and that the Russia-Ukraine War has only exacerbated this trend. He noted that far-right parties are becoming more mainstream, and that they pose a significant threat to European democracy.

Hannah agreed, stating that the rise of far-right parties is a cause for concern. She noted that these parties are becoming more emboldened and that they are capitalizing on the political divisions created by the Russia-Ukraine War. She also emphasized the need for European countries to work together to combat the rise of far-right extremism.

Anna Hana concluded by stating that the rise of far-right politics in Europe is a complex issue, driven by a combination of ideological and economic factors. She noted that the Russia-Ukraine War has only exacerbated these factors, leading to a more polarized and divided Europe. She emphasized the need for a more nuanced understanding of the rise of far-right politics in Europe, and for European countries to work together to address this growing threat.

In conclusion, the Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 panel on the rise of far-right politics and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine War highlighted the growing threat of far-right extremism in Europe. The panelists agreed that the Russia-Ukraine War has exacerbated political divisions in Europe and created an opportunity for far-right parties to gain more political power. They also emphasized the need for European countries to work together to combat the rise of far-right extremism and promote a more democratic and united Europe.

# Chapter 3: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Democracy: A Symposium on Europe's Futures

The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 gathered prominent scholars, policymakers, and practitioners to discuss the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) on democracy. This chapter presents a transcript of a morning panel session, moderated by German scholar Gregor Mikov, which explored the intersection of AI and democracy, focusing on the role of universities in fostering critical thinking and discernment in the age of AI.

## The State of AI and Its Impact on Democracy

### **Gregor Mikov's Introduction**

The symposium began with Mikov's introduction, in which he acknowledged the potential of AI to revolutionize various sectors, including academia. He emphasized the need for caution, as AI could also pose significant challenges to democracy. Mikov highlighted the recent case of a German photographer winning a prestigious award for an AI-generated photograph, raising questions about authorship and intellectual property in the digital age.

### **Katy Hayward's Keynote Address**

Katy Hayward, a professor of political sociology at Queen's University Belfast and a fellow at the Senator George Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security, and Justice, delivered the keynote address. Hayward argued that universities have a unique role to play in fostering critical thinking and ethical reasoning in the face of AI's growing influence. She presented a dystopian image generated by an AI algorithm to illustrate the potential threats posed by unregulated AI development.

Hayward emphasized the importance of discernment in navigating the AI landscape, drawing on religious traditions that prioritize patient reflection over immediate gratification. She called for a future-oriented approach that prioritizes creativity and collaboration over mere functionality and convenience. Hayward argued that universities must foster critical thinking and civic awareness to counteract the potential biases and misinformation embedded in AI systems.

### **Discussion and Commentary**

#### **Luke Cooper's Perspective**

Luke Cooper, a research fellow at the Conflict, Civicness, and Social Change research group and co-founder of Another Europe is Possible, offered his perspective on AI's impact on democracy. He discussed the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which AI algorithms were used to manipulate political opinion, and the potential for AI to exacerbate social inequalities. Cooper called for strategic and tactical thinking in countering the misuse of AI by political actors.

#### **Sonia Boan, NIC's Perspective**

Sonia Boan, the executive director of the Center for Advanced Study on Southeast Europe and a professor at the Academy of Applied Arts in Rijeka, echoed Hayward's concerns about the potential for AI to erode critical thinking and ethical reasoning. She argued that universities must prioritize liberal arts education as a prerequisite for liberal democracy. Boan called for a holistic approach to education that fosters reflection, creativity, and collaboration over superficiality and convenience.

## The Role of Universities in Fostering Critical Thinking and Discernment

The panelists discussed the role of universities in fostering critical thinking and discernment in the age of AI. Hayward argued that universities must prioritize the development of human intelligence alongside AI capabilities. Cooper emphasized the need for universities to engage in critical and strategic thinking about AI's implications for society. Boan called for a renewed emphasis on liberal arts education and a holistic approach to education that prioritizes reflection and depth over superficiality.

### **The Challenge of Bullshitting and Disinformation**

One of the key challenges raised by the panelists was the proliferation of bullshitting and disinformation enabled by AI algorithms. Cooper and Boan both emphasized the need for universities to equip students with the skills to discern fact from fiction in the digital age. Hayward argued that universities must foster critical thinking and ethical reasoning to counteract the potential biases and misinformation embedded in AI systems.

### **The Need for Strategic and Tactical Thinking**

Cooper emphasized the importance of strategic and tactical thinking in countering the misuse of AI by political actors. He argued that universities must engage in critical and strategic thinking about AI's implications for society, rather than simply embracing new technologies without consideration for their social and political consequences.

### **The Importance of Liberal Arts Education**

Boan echoed Hayward's call for a renewed emphasis on liberal arts education, arguing that universities must prioritize the development of critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness. She emphasized the importance of fostering reflection, creativity, and collaboration over superficiality and convenience, drawing on religious traditions that prioritize patient reflection over immediate gratification.

## Conclusion

The panelists agreed that universities have a crucial role to play in fostering critical thinking and discernment in the age of AI. They argued that universities must prioritize the development of human intelligence alongside AI capabilities, engage in critical and strategic thinking about AI's implications for society, and prioritize liberal arts education as a prerequisite for liberal democracy.

The symposium highlighted the urgent need for universities to engage with the challenges posed by AI and to adapt their curricula and pedagogical approaches accordingly. By fostering critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness, universities can help ensure that AI development serves the interests of democratic societies rather than undermining them.

# Chapter 7: Graffiti Wars and State Complicity in Belgrade

## Introduction

The annual symposium hosted by Europe's Futures in 2024 brought together a diverse range of speakers, among them Vladimir Arsić, a Serbian writer, cultural worker, and activist. Arsić's presentation, "Neosa Street: A Case Study in the Rise of Cultural Violence," delved into the complex interplay of far-right extremism, state complicity, and societal indifference in Belgrade, Serbia. This chapter will summarize and analyze Arsić's insights, drawing from the transcript of his presentation.

## The Rise of Far-Right Extremism in Belgrade

Arsić began by outlining the escalating presence of far-right extremism in Belgrade, exemplified by the proliferation of hateful and violent graffiti along Neosa Street, a central thoroughfare in the municipality of Belgrade. The graffiti, often glorifying war criminals and promoting anti-ethnic and anti-nationalistic sentiments, has become a symbol of the street's transformation into a hub for far-right activity.

### The Role of Football Hooligans

A significant factor contributing to this rise is the involvement of football hooligans, particularly those affiliated with the partisan football club. These groups have been instrumental in spreading far-right propaganda and violent ideologies, often targeting schools and other public institutions. Arsić highlighted a particularly egregious incident where a 13-year-old boy, inspired by the hateful content on Neosa Street, went on a shooting spree at a Belgrade school, murdering seven students and a school guard.

### State Complicity and Inaction

Arsić argued that the Serbian state bears significant responsibility for the proliferation of far-right extremism. He noted that the police and other state institutions have repeatedly turned a blind eye to the hateful activities on Neosa Street, often refusing to intervene or prosecute those involved. Moreover, the government has failed to take meaningful action to address the root causes of far-right extremism, instead allowing the problem to fester and grow.

## The Struggle Against Cultural Violence

Arsić also discussed the various initiatives and movements working to counteract the rise of cultural violence in Belgrade. These include:

### The Crocodile Literary Festival

Arsić, as the president of the Crocodile Literary Festival, described the festival's mission to create a platform for writers and artists from different countries to meet, read, and engage with one another. The festival aims to foster cross-border dialogue and cooperation, countering the divisive and nationalist rhetoric propagated by far-right groups.

### The Institute for Democracy, Sovereignty, and Civilization

Arsić praised the work of the Institute for Democracy, Sovereignty, and Civilization (IDSC) and its think tank, Scopia. The IDSC has been at the forefront of advocating for EU enlargement and Europeanization in the Western Balkans, working to promote democratic values, human rights, and regional cooperation.

### The "Remember" Campaign

Arsić also mentioned the "Remember" campaign, which seeks to memorialize and commemorate the victims of the Bosnian War. The campaign aims to challenge the revisionist and nationalist narratives promoted by far-right groups and to foster a more inclusive and reconciled society.

## The Spillover Effect and the Future of Belgrade

Arsić concluded his presentation by reflecting on the spillover effect of far-right extremism in the region. He noted that the rise of far-right ideologies and hateful content in Belgrade has significant implications for the rest of the Western Balkans, as well as for Europe as a whole. Arsić called upon the international community to take a more active role in addressing the root causes of far-right extremism and promoting democratic values, human rights, and regional cooperation.

## Conclusion

Vladimir Arsić's presentation at the Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 provided a stark reminder of the challenges posed by far-right extremism, state complicity, and societal indifference. By highlighting the plight of Neosa Street and the struggles of those working to counter cultural violence, Arsić underscored the urgent need for collective action and international engagement. As Arsić emphasized, the future of Belgrade – and indeed, the Western Balkans and Europe – hangs in the balance.

# Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024: Russia - A Historical Perspective

## Introduction

The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024, held at an unspecified location, brought together a panel of experts to discuss the historical trajectory of Russia and its potential impact on the future. The session was moderated by Tom Deval, who introduced the topic and the panelists: Kadri, a historian with a personal connection to Russia; Gregor Mikov, an analyst from the European Council on Foreign Relations; and Rosa Di, a journalist who covered Russia during the perestroika era. The panelists were invited to share their insights on Russia's history and the possibilities for its future.

## The Personal Perspective: Kadri

Kadri began by sharing his personal journey with Russia. Growing up in Estonia during the Soviet era, he first visited Moscow in 1987 and was captivated by the city and its people. Over the years, he witnessed Russia's transformation from a communist state to a post-Soviet society, and eventually to the authoritarian regime under Vladimir Putin. Kadri's experiences shaped his understanding of Russia and its people, leading him to question the linear narrative of Russian history often presented in the West.

Kadri chose to focus his research on the perestroika era (1985-1991), a period of recent Russian history that he believed had been overlooked in favor of the more dramatic events surrounding the collapse of the Soviet Union. He sought to explore the fluid and creative nature of this time, when societal changes happened rapidly and unpredictably, allowing for both thrilling and disturbing experiences.

One of Kadri's goals in his research was to challenge the Western linear narrative of Russia's struggle against communism and its journey towards democracy and independence. He argued that this simplified perspective overlooked the complexities and nuances of Russia's historical trajectory. Instead, he proposed a more cyclical dynamic, where competition between the state and society has characterized Russia's history, with periods of creativity and openness followed by repression and consolidation of power.

Kadri's personal experiences and historical insights led him to question the prospects for democratic change in Russia. While he acknowledged the presence of skilled technocrats in the Russian society who could drive such change, he was skeptical about their ability to challenge Putin's regime. He suggested that the Russian society today is more passive and resigned to the status quo than it was during the perestroika era.

## The Political Economy Perspective: Mikov

Mikov approached the topic from an analytical perspective, focusing on the economic reforms that took place during the perestroika era and their relevance to Russia's future. He argued that the Soviet economy had reached a point of crisis by the mid-1980s, with a command economy that could no longer deliver basic consumer goods to its citizens. Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika reforms aimed to address this crisis, but they ultimately proved insufficient.

Mikov believed that Gorbachev's mistake was in not understanding the extent of the Soviet economy's problems and the need for more profound reforms. He cited a report published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1964, which had warned of the impending economic crisis but was ignored by the leadership. Mikov also noted that Gorbachev's reforms failed to address the issue of corruption and non-monetary privileges enjoyed by the nomenklatura, the Soviet elite.

Mikov argued that the perestroika era offered an opportunity for economic reform, but that opportunity was missed. He suggested that the Western support for Gorbachev's reforms, both financial and political, was misguided, as it did not address the underlying issues of the Soviet economy. Instead, the Western aid was often stolen by the nomenklatura and used to enrich themselves.

Mikov's analysis led him to question the prospects for economic reform in Russia today. He was skeptical about the ability of Putin's regime to implement meaningful reforms, given its reliance on state capitalism and its resistance to challenging the vested interests of the elite. He also noted that Russia's economy was heavily dependent on oil exports, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices.

## The Journalistic Perspective: Di

Di, a journalist who covered Russia during the perestroika era, offered a more anecdotal perspective on the topic. She shared her experiences of reporting on the rapid changes taking place in Russia at that time, from the introduction ofglasnost (openness) and the emergence of new political movements to the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union.

Di recalled the sense of optimism and possibility that characterized the perestroika era, as well as the underlying tension and uncertainty. She noted that the Soviet Union was a complex and diverse society, with different regions and groups experiencing the changes in different ways. She also highlighted the role of intellectuals and reform-minded communists in pushing for change, as well as the resistance from more conservative elements within the Soviet elite.

Di's journalistic perspective allowed her to observe the complexities and contradictions of the perestroika era. She noted, for example, the emergence of new political movements, such as the Democratic Union and the Interregional Group of People's Deputies, which advocated for greater democratic rights and freedoms. At the same time, she witnessed the rise of more nationalist and conservative movements, such as the Russian Communist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party, which sought to preserve the Soviet Union's territorial integrity and to resist the forces of change.

Di also reflected on the role of the West in the perestroika era. She noted the Western support for Gorbachev's reforms, as well as the Western aid that flowed into the Soviet Union during this time. She suggested that the West had made mistakes in its approach to the Soviet Union, both in underestimating the challenges of reform and in overestimating the prospects for democratic change.

## The Panel Discussion

The panelists then engaged in a discussion, moderated by Deval, on the prospects for Russia's future. Kadri reiterated his skepticism about the possibilities for democratic change in Russia, given the passivity of Russian society and the resilience of Putin's regime. He also questioned the wisdom of the West's approach to Russia, noting that the West had supported Gorbachev's reforms in the hope of promoting democratic change, but that this approach had ultimately failed.

Mikov offered a more pessimistic perspective on Russia's future. He argued that Russia's economy was in a precarious position, with its dependence on oil exports making it vulnerable to external shocks. He also noted that Putin's regime had shown little inclination to implement meaningful economic reforms, instead relying on state capitalism and the exploitation of Russia's natural resources. Mikov suggested that Russia's future was likely to be characterized by economic stagnation and political repression.

Di offered a more nuanced perspective on Russia's future. She acknowledged the challenges facing Russia, from its economic dependence on oil exports to the political repression of Putin's regime. At the same time, she noted the presence of a vibrant civil society in Russia, as well as the emergence of new political movements and initiatives. She suggested that the prospects for Russia's future were uncertain, but that there was still potential for change and reform.

## Conclusion

The Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 panel on Russia offered a range of perspectives on the historical trajectory of the country and its prospects for the future. Kadri's personal and historical insights, Mikov's analytical approach, and Di's journalistic perspective all contributed to a nuanced and complex understanding of Russia's past and its potential futures.

# The Rise of the Far Right in Slovakia: An Analysis of the 2024 European Futures Annual Symposium

The 2024 edition of Europe's Futures Annual Symposium brought together leading experts and academics to discuss the pressing issues shaping the continent's political landscape. Among the most contentious topics addressed was the rise of the far right in Slovakia, and its implications for the country's democratic institutions and European integration. This chapter presents a transcript of the panel discussion on this subject, followed by an analysis of the key points raised.

## Panel Discussion: The Rise of the Far Right in Slovakia

**Moderator (M):** Good morning. Unfortunately, Kolina Viura cannot be with us today due to a family reason. Instead, we have Alida Raic, Peter Kco, and Gian Maria Nikolov to discuss the dramatic events that have unfolded in Slovakia over the past year. Gian Maria, please begin with an introduction to the assassination attempt on Prime Minister Fico and its implications for Slovakia and Europe.

**Gian Maria Nikolov (GMN):** Thank you. Last year, Slovakia witnessed an unprecedented event – the assassination attempt on Prime Minister Robert Fico. The fallout from this event has led to new political compositions and European commission course council election results. Fico is currently recovering from his injuries, and Vice Prime Minister Robert Kakiak, who was appointed as his replacement, is fulfilling his duties. The political situation in Slovakia remains stable, but a blaming game has started between the ruling coalition and the opposition, with allegations that seem baseless.

The assassination attempt on Fico raises several questions about the political development in Slovakia. To begin with, it is essential to understand the two main political parties competing for power: the national populist PR, led by Fico, and the liberal democratic party, representing the main cleavage in Slovak society. The exception here is the government formed by the national populist party and the liberal democratic party.

The assassination attempt on Fico marked a turning point in Slovak politics. It led to the resignation of Fico, who was acting prime minister at the time. He was ousted by popular demand due to his position in the murder case of journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kušnírová. Fico's resignation was evidence of the people's involvement in the process, as he lived in the same building as one of the suspects, Marian Kachner, a close party member of SMER.

Following Fico's resignation, the ruling coalition formed a new government led by Igor Matovič, the leader of the Ordinary People and Independent Personalities (OLaNO) party. The coalition between OLaNO, SMER, and the Slovak National Party (SNS) was strange and unusual, as it included the national populist coalition center-right party, Libertarians, and the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH).

Matovič's governance has been problematic and chaotic, with conflicts arising within the ruling coalition and aggressive opposition from other political parties. The police have been given free rein to investigate many wrongdoings, leading to Robert Fico becoming an actor in several corrupt cases. Fico has been accused of multiple criminal acts and is currently facing legal action.

In the context of the upcoming election, Fico has become the leader of the anti-mask and anti-epidemic movement, focusing on appealing to a group of the population that is friendly to Russia and its geopolitical illusions. The ruling coalition has imploded due to internal disintegration, leading to the government being replaced by a technocratic government led by Ludovic Oda.

The assassination attempt on Fico has led to a transformation in Slovakia's political landscape. Two categories of political parties are now competing: national populist parties and liberal democratic parties. The national populist parties, including PR and SMER, represent the Hungarian minority and are far-right parties representing the far-right camp. In contrast, the liberal democratic parties, such as PR/PD and the Slovak National Party (SNP), form the liberal democratic camp.

The assassination attempt on Fico has led to a polarization of Slovak society and a rising confrontation between the two political camps. The assassination attempt can be seen as an extreme case of political violence, highlighting the polarization and deep-rooted political divisions in Slovakia.

### Analysis of the Panel Discussion

The panel discussion on the rise of the far right in Slovakia highlighted several crucial points:

1. **The assassination attempt on Prime Minister Fico**: The assassination attempt on Fico marked a turning point in Slovak politics, leading to his resignation and the formation of a new government. It also exposed the deep-seated divisions within Slovak society and the political elite.
2. **The two main political camps**: The panelists identified two main political camps in Slovakia – the national populist camp, led by Fico and PR, and the liberal democratic camp, represented by PR/PD and SNP. The national populist camp is far-right and represents the Hungarian minority, while the liberal democratic camp is more progressive and pro-European.
3. **Polarization and confrontation**: The assassination attempt on Fico has led to a rise in political polarization and confrontation between the two camps. This polarization is deeply rooted in Slovak society and has led to a confrontational style of politics, with aggressive rhetoric used by both sides.
4. **The role of media**: The panelists discussed the role of the media in contributing to the polarization of Slovak society. They argued that the ruling coalition had provoked public disagreement by abolishing the Office of the Special Prosecutor and the Office of the Public Prosecutor, which were independent investigative bodies. This move was seen as an attempt to cleanse the law enforcement organs and reduce the space for independent media.
5. **The impact on European integration**: The rise of the far right in Slovakia has implications for European integration. The panelists discussed how the assassination attempt on Fico and the subsequent political turmoil have affected Slovakia's position on key European issues, such as migration and Russia's aggression in Ukraine.

## Conclusion

The rise of the far right in Slovakia is a complex and multifaceted issue, with deep-seated divisions within the political elite and society. The assassination attempt on Prime Minister Fico has exposed these divisions and led to a transformation in Slovakia's political landscape. The panelists in the 2024 Europe's Futures Annual Symposium discussed the key aspects of this transformation and its implications for Slovakia and Europe.

The panelists highlighted the need for reconciliation and a reckoning with the ruling coalition's actions, which have contributed to the polarization of Slovak society. They also stressed the importance of maintaining democratic institutions and the rule of law in the face of the far right's rise. The panelists agreed that the rise of the far right in Slovakia has implications for European integration, particularly in the areas of migration and Russia's aggression in Ukraine. However, they also noted that the far right's rise has not led to a drastic change in Slovakia's institutional system or national government.

The panelists' discussion underscored the need for a nuanced understanding of the far right's rise in Slovakia and the complex interplay between political divisions, media, and European integration. Their analysis serves as a useful starting point for further research on this critical issue in European politics.

# Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024: Harnessing Citizen Assemblies for Democratic Resilience

The second session of Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 kicked off with an intriguing subject: "Inclusive and Participatory Democracy: Can Citizen Assemblies Bridge Division within Democratic Societies?" Speakers and attendees alike were eager to dive into the intricacies of this topic, which revolved around the potential of citizen assemblies to address authoritarian tendencies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) amidst geopolitical instability.

## The Case for Citizen Assemblies in CEE

**Anastasia L.,** a fellow at Democracy Next and a key speaker in this session, opened the discussion by presenting a compelling argument for the benefits of citizen assemblies in CEE. She began by sharing her personal journey and her organization's mission to design and advise on the implementation of citizen assemblies.

Anastasia started by setting a diagnosis for the region: CEE faces internal power capture, foreign interference, and democratic erosion, compounded by disinformation, division, and a willingness to fracture and weaken democratic institutions. She noted that CEE's young democracies have weaker institutions and less citizen engagement than their Western counterparts, making them particularly vulnerable to these threats.

Against this backdrop, Anastasia argued that citizen assemblies could serve as a resilient tool for building democratic muscle and empathy. She highlighted two key elements that distinguish citizen assemblies from other forms of political engagement:

1. **Deliberation**: Unlike debates or dialogues, deliberation in citizen assemblies aims to find common ground and overlap rather than convince others to adopt one's perspective. This seeks to develop solutions that consider the diverse views and interests within society.
2. **Random selection**: Citizen assemblies use a form of sortition, randomly selecting a representative group of citizens to participate. This ensures a broad cross-section of society is involved and helps mitigate the risk of capture by particular interest groups.

Anastasia drew on examples of citizen assemblies from around the world, including France and Ireland, to illustrate their potential impact. She also referenced a study by the OECD, which found 700 examples of citizen assemblies across the globe, indicating a growing trend in their use.

## Building Resilient Democracies with Citizen Assemblies

**Anna S.,** another speaker in the session, picked up on Anastasia's argument and expanded on how citizen assemblies could help build resilient democracies in CEE. She echoed Anastasia's concerns about the region's vulnerability to authoritarian tendencies and emphasized the need for innovative solutions to strengthen democratic institutions.

Anna argued that citizen assemblies could serve as a bulwark against authoritarianism by:

1. **Providing a forum for informed conversation**: Citizen assemblies bring together a diverse group of citizens to engage with experts and stakeholders, raising the quality of public debate and helping to reduce misinformation.
2. **Fostering a sense of agency and civic responsibility**: Participating in a citizen assembly can empower citizens and encourage them to engage more deeply with democratic processes.
3. **Innovating and adapting to context-specific issues**: Citizen assemblies can be tailored to address specific challenges facing a society, such as climate change or urban development.

Anna also addressed potential challenges in implementing citizen assemblies in CEE, including securing political commitment and navigating hierarchical political cultures. She stressed the importance of international collaboration and funding, such as through the EU, to support and uphold deliberative standards.

## The Role of Citizen Assemblies in Addressing Populism and Disinformation

**Heather M.** and **Alberto G.** joined the conversation to explore the role of citizen assemblies in addressing populism and disinformation, two pressing challenges in CEE and beyond.

**Heather** argued that citizen assemblies could help address populism by providing a forum for informed deliberation, enabling citizens to make decisions based on evidence and expertise rather than emotion or prejudice. She also suggested that citizen assemblies could help counteract populist manipulation of democratic institutions by providing a more inclusive and deliberative alternative to representative democracy.

**Alberto** raised concerns about the potential for citizen assemblies to be hijacked by populist forces. He emphasized the need for robust safeguards, such as independent oversight committees and transparent governance structures, to prevent this from happening. He also noted that citizen assemblies should not be seen as a panacea for addressing populism, but rather as one tool among many.

**Anna** responded to Alberto's concerns by highlighting the importance of designing citizen assemblies in ways that promote cross-partisan support and mitigate the risk of populist capture. She also stressed the need for careful consideration of the political context in which citizen assemblies are implemented.

## The Future of Citizen Assemblies in Europe

As the session drew to a close, speakers and attendees alike reflected on the potential of citizen assemblies to strengthen democracy in CEE and beyond. **Anastasia** reiterated her belief in the power of citizen assemblies to build resilience against authoritarian tendencies, noting that they could serve as a bulwark against the spread of autocracy.

**Anna** echoed Anastasia's optimism, but also sounded a note of caution. She emphasized the need for careful consideration of the political context in which citizen assemblies are implemented and for ongoing evaluation and adaptation to ensure their effectiveness.

**Heather** and **Alberto** agreed that citizen assemblies could play a valuable role in addressing populism and disinformation, but also stressed the need for vigilance to prevent their misuse. They suggested that citizen assemblies should be seen as part of a broader toolkit for strengthening democracy, rather than a silver bullet.

As the session ended, attendees left with a renewed appreciation for the potential of citizen assemblies to strengthen democracy in CEE and beyond. The conversation at Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024 had made it clear that, while there are challenges to implementing citizen assemblies, their benefits for democratic resilience are too great to ignore.

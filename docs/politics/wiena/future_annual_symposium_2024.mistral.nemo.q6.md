# Chapter 7: The Aart PK Memorial Lecture - Navigating Global Contestation in an Era of Uncertainty

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024, held under the grand arches of the Palais des Festivals in Cannes, was a spectacle of intellect and diplomacy. The event's centerpiece, the Aart PK Memorial Lecture, was an evening of reflection, remembrance, and foresight. This chapter captures the essence of that lecture, delivered by the distinguished Austrian diplomat, Wang Petri, who stood at the precipice of a world in flux, contemplating the geopolitical landscape and Europe's role in it.

## A Tribute to Aart PK

Wang Petri began his lecture with a tribute to the symposium's namesake, Aart PK, a mentor, friend, and architect of the University of Vienna's Center for Advanced Study. Reflecting on their conflict-free relationship, Petri acknowledged PK's unique blend of intellectual arrogance and practical politicking. He recounted visiting PK's office, a poignant reminder of the man who had navigated Yugoslavia's disintegration and the Bosnian War, and who later served as Austria's Permanent Representative to the UN and OECD, and President of the Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation. Petri's words were a testament to PK's legacy as a rare breed of public intellectual and politician.

## A Sweeping Overview of the Global Landscape

Petri then turned his gaze to the contemporary geopolitical scene, titled "Contestation: A New Dynamic Driving Global Politics." He noted the shift from the post-Cold War era's relative optimism to the current multipolar world, marked by Russia's aggression in Ukraine and the resurgence of nationalism and populism. The global order, he argued, was at a crossroads, with the United States, China, and other powers jostling for influence, and the UN system under strain.

Petri identified three contestations shaping global affairs:

1. **Territorial Contestation**: From Ukraine to the South China Sea, territorial disputes were on the rise, challenging the post-WWII order. Europe, Petri argued, needed a consistent policy towards such contests, avoiding double standards and promoting norms of behavior.

2. **Climate Finance Contestation**: The widening gap between the Global North and South, exemplified by debt burdens and unequal access to technology, threatened global cooperation on climate change. Petri called for a reform of the international financial system to address this imbalance.

3. **Normative Contestation**: The rise of illiberal democracies and the erosion of multilateral institutions challenged the liberal international order. Petri stressed the need for Europe to defend and adapt its values and norms to this changing landscape.

## Europe's Role in the New World Order

Petri then turned to Europe's role in this contested world. He noted the EU's regulatory leadership in areas like artificial intelligence but cautioned against complacency. The EU, he argued, must deepen integration, particularly in foreign and defense policy, to navigate the challenges ahead. It must also recognize the power of tech giants and address widening inequality, both within and beyond its borders.

Petri concluded with a call to faith in Europe's future, echoing PK's spirit. He urged the audience, the "Europe Futures Fellows," to engage with the uncharted waters ahead, imbued with a spirit of seriousness and faith in the predetermined path of history.

## Reflections on the Lecture

Wang Petri's lecture was a masterclass in diplomatic speaking, balancing remembrance, analysis, and prescription. It served as a stark reminder of the complexities and uncertainties of our time, and the need for Europe to adapt and engage. As the symposium attendees filed out of the auditorium, the echoes of Petri's words lingered, a call to action in an era of contestation.

# Chapter 7: Reimagining Europe's Democratic Future at the Futures Annual Symposium 2024

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 buzzed with an electric atmosphere as leading academics, policymakers, and activists converged to debate Europe's democratic future. The day's proceedings, marked by insightful presentations and lively discussions, offered a panoramic view of the continent's challenges and opportunities. This chapter delves into the key insights and proposals presented during the symposium, focusing on the need for democratic renewal, the role of citizen participation, and the potential of a more integrated, democratic European Union.

## **Democratic Deficits and the Need for Renewal**

The symposium kicked off with a stark assessment of Europe's democratic health. Alberto Alano, a prominent political scientist, reminded the audience that Europe's democratic trajectory has been marked by a persistent "permissive consensus," wherein citizens have largely accepted European integration without being fully engaged in decision-making processes. This has led to a democratic deficit, characterized by a lack of citizen input and a sense of disconnection from European institutions.

Alano argued that this deficit has been exacerbated by the rise of technocratic governance, which prioritizes efficiency and expertise over democratic accountability. The result, he warned, is a European Union that is increasingly perceived as remote and undemocratic, fueling populist backlashes and undermining citizens' trust in the Union.

To address this, Alano proposed a two-pronged approach: first, representative democracy needs to be reinvigorated by making European institutions more accountable to citizens; second, participatory democracy should be strengthened to give citizens a direct say in European decision-making. This, he believed, would help restore Europe's democratic vitality and legitimacy.

## **Citizen Participation: A Pathway to Democratic Renewal**

The call for enhanced citizen participation resonated throughout the symposium. Rosa Balfour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, echoed Alano's concerns and offered concrete proposals for fostering a more participatory Europe.

Balfour suggested that European institutions create a dedicated channel for citizen participation, akin to a European-level "ombudsman" or complaint mechanism. This would enable citizens to engage directly with European decision-making processes, providing a means for them to voice their concerns and influence policy outcomes.

Moreover, Balfour proposed a European-level "constituent assembly" to give citizens a direct say in constitutional matters. Such an assembly, she argued, would offer a powerful mechanism for citizens to shape Europe's democratic future, fostering a sense of ownership and engagement with the Union.

Nicola Dimitro, a political scientist at the University of Westminster, added another layer to the debate. He contended that Europe's democratic renewal must extend beyond institutional reforms to encompass the continent's diverse civil societies. This, he argued, would necessitate a more inclusive European public sphere, one that facilitates transnational dialogue and collaboration.

## **Rethinking Europe's Democratic Geography**

The symposium also explored the spatial dimensions of Europe's democratic renewal. The debate here centered on the desirability and feasibility of a more integrated, democratic European Union.

Alberto Alano, picking up on a theme from his opening remarks, argued for a rethinking of Europe's accession process. He proposed that candidate countries should be required to hold a referendum on their accession terms, giving citizens a direct say in their country's EU membership. This, he believed, would enhance the democratic legitimacy of EU membership and foster a more engaged, democratic Europe.

Nicola Dimitro, meanwhile, suggested that Europe could learn from the experience of federal systems like the United States and Canada. He proposed that Europe adopt a "dual federalism" model, in which power is shared between a European federation and its member states. This, he argued, would strike a balance between the need for European-level decision-making and the importance of local and national democratic governance.

## **The European Election: A Missed Opportunity**

The symposium closed with a lament for Europe's democratic future. Participants bemoaned the continent's inability to capitalize on the potential of the European election, which remains a largely ignored democratic opportunity.

Alberto Alano, in a particularly impassioned moment, decried Europe's failure to create a truly European political space. He argued that the European election remains a largely national affair, with European-level political parties and transnational lists struggling to gain traction. This, he contended, undermines the potential of the European election to foster a more integrated, democratic Europe.

Rosa Balfour, too, expressed her frustration with Europe's inability to harness the democratic potential of the European election. She suggested that Europe could learn from the experience of other transnational elections, such as those held in the United States and Canada, to create a more meaningful European-level political contest.

## **Conclusion**

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 offered a rich and varied exploration of Europe's democratic future. The symposium's participants, drawn from the continent's leading academic, policy, and activist circles, offered a diverse range of perspectives on the challenges and opportunities facing Europe's democratic renewal.

At the heart of the symposium's debates lay a shared concern: Europe's democratic vitality is at risk, and urgent action is needed to address this. The proposals offered - from institutional reforms to enhance citizen participation, to spatial rethinkings of Europe's democratic geography, to a more integrated, democratic European Union - offer a range of potential avenues for Europe's democratic renewal.

Yet, as the symposium closed, there was a sense of unease among the participants. Europe, they seemed to agree, has squandered the democratic opportunities that lie within its grasp. As the continent faces an uncertain future, the challenge remains: how to harness Europe's democratic potential, and restore the continent's democratic vitality and legitimacy?

# Chapter 7: The Rise of Far-Right Populism in Europe: Consequences and Countermeasures

The 2024 Futures Annual Symposium brought together experts from various fields to discuss the pressing issue of the rise of far-right populism in Europe, with a particular focus on the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war and the 2024 European Parliament elections. This chapter will delve into the key points raised during the symposium, focusing on the ideological underpinnings of far-right populism, its relationship with Russian aggression, and potential countermeasures to mitigate its influence.

## Ideological Underpinnings of Far-Right Populism

The symposium opened with a panel discussion moderated by Hannah Shelest, featuring Peter Balash and Ivan Stefanovic. Balash, a specialist in political ideology, provided a nuanced analysis of the far-right political spectrum, emphasizing that far-right parties are primarily driven by a domestic-oriented political program and anti-establishment sentiment.

### Domestic Orientation and Anti-establishment Sentiment

Balash argued that far-right parties prioritize domestic issues, with migration and national identity often at the forefront. This focus on domestic concerns is coupled with a strong anti-establishment sentiment, which manifests as opposition to the European Union, liberal democratic values, and multiculturalism. This ideological position is reflected in their policies, which often include restrictions on immigration, prioritization of national interests, and a rollback of liberal democratic norms.

### Anti-Americanism and Anti-European Union Sentiment

A crucial aspect of far-right ideology is its opposition to the United States and the European Union. Balash noted that far-right parties often frame the United States as an imperialistic force and the European Union as a bureaucratic, undemocratic institution. This anti-Americanism and anti-European Union sentiment can be traced back to historical grievances and a desire to assert national sovereignty.

### The Role of Anti-Immigration Sentiment

The symposium also touched on the role of anti-immigration sentiment in the rise of far-right populism. Balash suggested that far-right parties have successfully mobilized discontent over immigration, positioning themselves as the champions of the 'native' population against an influx of 'outsiders.' This strategy has proven particularly effective in countries with high levels of immigration and a strong far-right presence.

## Far-Right Populism and the Russian-Ukrainian War

The Russian-Ukrainian war was another key topic of discussion at the symposium. The panelists explored how the war has influenced the far-right political landscape in Europe, with Stefanovic noting that the war has provided an opportunity for far-right parties to gain traction by presenting themselves as pro-Ukraine and anti-Russian.

### The Ukrainian Issue and Far-Right Narratives

Stefanovic argued that far-right parties have successfully framed the Ukrainian issue as a struggle for national sovereignty, resonating with their core supporters who share similar sentiments. This narrative has allowed far-right parties to gain support in countries such as Hungary and Poland, where nationalist sentiment runs high.

### Far-Right Parties and the Ukrainian Cause

Despite their pro-Ukraine rhetoric, far-right parties have been criticized for not offering meaningful support to the Ukrainian cause. Balash noted that while far-right parties may express solidarity with Ukraine, they often fail to translate these sentiments into concrete actions. This hypocrisy has not gone unnoticed, with many far-right parties facing criticism for their lack of support for Ukraine.

### The Impact of the War on Far-Right Support

The panelists also discussed the impact of the war on far-right support. Balash suggested that the war has had a polarizing effect, with far-right parties gaining support in countries where there is a strong anti-Russian sentiment. However, he also noted that the war has not had a uniform impact, with some far-right parties experiencing a decline in support.

## The 2024 European Parliament Elections and Far-Right Populism

The 2024 European Parliament elections were another key topic of discussion at the symposium. The panelists explored how the elections could influence the far-right political landscape in Europe.

### The Potential for Far-Right Gains

The panelists expressed concern that far-right parties could make significant gains in the 2024 European Parliament elections. Balash noted that far-right parties have been gaining ground in national elections across Europe and that there is no reason to believe that this trend will not continue in the European Parliament elections.

### The Threat of Far-Right Influence in the European Parliament

The panelists also discussed the threat posed by far-right influence in the European Parliament. Balash noted that far-right parties have been increasingly effective in using their presence in the European Parliament to push their agenda and influence European policy. This influence could have significant implications for European integration and democratic norms.

### Countermeasures Against Far-Right Populism

Given the threat posed by far-right populism, the panelists also discussed potential countermeasures. Balash suggested that mainstream political parties need to do a better job of addressing the concerns of far-right voters and offering viable alternatives. He also noted that the European Union could play a role in countering far-right populism by promoting a more democratic and inclusive model of European integration.

## The Role of Mainstream Political Parties

The symposium also touched on the role of mainstream political parties in countering far-right populism. Balash argued that mainstream parties have failed to adequately address the concerns of far-right voters, leaving the field open for far-right parties to mobilize discontent. He suggested that mainstream parties need to do a better job of engaging with far-right voters and offering viable alternatives to far-right policies.

## Conclusion

The 2024 Futures Annual Symposium provided a comprehensive overview of the rise of far-right populism in Europe, with a particular focus on the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war and the 2024 European Parliament elections. The symposium highlighted the ideological underpinnings of far-right populism, its relationship with Russian aggression, and potential countermeasures to mitigate its influence. The panelists agreed that far-right populism poses a significant threat to European democracy and integration, and that mainstream political parties need to take a more active role in countering its influence.

The symposium also emphasized the need for further research into the causes and consequences of far-right populism. While much has been written on the topic, there is still much we do not know about the factors driving far-right support and the most effective ways to counter it. The symposium provided a valuable opportunity to bring together experts from various fields to share their insights and perspectives on this pressing issue. As we approach the 2024 European Parliament elections, it is crucial that we continue to engage in this important conversation and work towards developing effective strategies to counter the threat posed by far-right populism.

# Chapter 3: The Future of AI in Academia: A Dialogue at Futures Annual Symposium 2024

## Introduction

The Futures Annual Symposium, held in 2024, brought together some of the brightest minds in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and academia to discuss the future of AI's role in education and research. This chapter presents a transcript of the morning panel discussion, titled "AI in Academia: A Path to Progress or Peril?", which explored the implications of AI's increasing presence in universities and research institutions.

## The Panel

The panel consisted of four experts in their respective fields:

1. **Katy Hayward**: Professor of Political Sociology at Queen's University Belfast and Co-Director of the Center for International Border Research. She is also a Senator George Mitchell Institute Fellow and Eisenhower Fellow, with numerous publications on European integration, Brexit, peace, and democratic processes.
2. **Luke Cooper**: A European Futures Fellow (Cohort 1819) and Associate Professor of Conflict and Civicness at the University of Kent. He is also the Director of the Kent Peace and Conflict Studies Research Group and has worked extensively on refugee integration, nationalism, and authoritarianism.
3. **Sonia Boanich**: Professor at the Academy of Applied Arts, University of Rijeka. She is an experienced scholar and artist focusing on contemporary gender, racial, and class issues, and has authored several books and numerous papers on the subject.
4. **Moderator**: A respected scholar and academic who facilitated the discussion.

## The Discussion

### Welcome and Introduction

The moderator began the session by welcoming the panelists and the audience, and then provided an overview of the morning's discussion:

> Welcome everyone to the Futures Annual Symposium 2024. I'm delighted to be joined by an incredible panel of experts who will be discussing the role of AI in academia. We'll be exploring how AI is already transforming the way we teach, learn, and conduct research, and looking ahead to consider the future implications of these changes. We have a lot to cover, so let's dive right in.

### AI in Academia: A Path to Progress or Peril?

**Katy Hayward** kicked off the discussion by presenting her concerns about the potential risks of AI in academia:

> AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we teach and learn, but we must be cautious about the challenges it poses. We're already seeing essay-writing tools that can generate human-like text, raising serious concerns about academic integrity and originality. Moreover, AI could exacerbate existing inequalities in higher education, as students with privileged access to advanced AI tools may gain an unfair advantage. We must consider these risks and work to mitigate them to ensure that AI is a force for good in academia.

**Luke Cooper** agreed with Hayward's concerns but offered a more optimistic perspective:

> While AI does present challenges, I believe it also offers significant opportunities for progress. For instance, AI-powered essay-writing tools could help students with writing difficulties or language barriers. Furthermore, AI can assist in research by automating tasks such as literature reviews or data analysis, freeing up researchers' time to focus on more complex tasks. To capitalize on these opportunities, we must address the challenges head-on and develop guidelines and regulations that ensure AI is used ethically and responsibly in academia.

**Sonia Boanich** weighed in on the discussion, highlighting the importance of fostering critical thinking and discernment in the face of AI's growing influence:

> AI has the potential to transform the way we think, learn, and communicate. However, we must be mindful of the ways in which it may also limit our ability to engage in critical thinking and discernment. We must teach students to question, evaluate, and reflect on the information they encounter, both from humans and machines. By fostering these skills, we can ensure that AI is a tool that enhances, rather than replaces, human intelligence.

The moderator then opened the floor to questions from the audience.

### The Future of AI in Academia

**Audience Member 1**: How can we ensure that AI is used ethically and responsibly in academia?

**Katy Hayward**: To ensure ethical and responsible use of AI in academia, we need clear guidelines and regulations, as well as robust systems for enforcing them. We must also prioritize transparency and accountability, making sure that AI-driven decisions can be understood and challenged if necessary. Additionally, we should foster a culture of ethical reflection and debate, encouraging academics to engage critically with the implications of AI in their fields.

**Luke Cooper**: I agree with Katy. We need to involve diverse stakeholders, including students, academics, and administrators, in developing these guidelines and regulations. We must also invest in AI literacy, ensuring that all members of the academic community have the knowledge and skills they need to use AI responsibly and critically. Finally, we should prioritize research into the long-term impacts of AI on higher education, to inform our decision-making and help us anticipate and mitigate any negative consequences.

**Audience Member 2**: How might AI change the role of the academic in the future?

**Sonia Boanich**: AI has the potential to transform the role of the academic in several ways. For instance, AI-powered tools could automate routine tasks, freeing up academics' time to focus on more creative and intellectually demanding activities. However, we must also be aware of the risks of over-reliance on AI, such as the potential loss of certain skills or the deskilling of academic work. To capitalize on the opportunities offered by AI while mitigating its risks, we must invest in reskilling and upskilling initiatives, as well as fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation.

**Katy Hayward**: I would add that AI could also change the nature of academic research, for example by enabling new forms of data analysis or facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration. However, we must ensure that AI is used to augment, rather than replace, human intelligence and creativity. We must also consider how AI might impact the dynamics of academic communities, such as the distribution of power and resources, and work to address any negative consequences.

### Conclusion

The panel discussion at the Futures Annual Symposium 2024 highlighted the complex and multifaceted nature of AI's role in academia. While AI offers significant opportunities for progress, it also presents considerable challenges that must be addressed if we are to ensure that it is a force for good in higher education. To navigate this complex landscape, we must engage in open and critical dialogue, involving diverse stakeholders and prioritizing ethical reflection and responsibility.

## Reflections and Next Steps

As we look ahead to a future in which AI plays an increasingly prominent role in academia, we must remain vigilant to the risks and challenges it presents. By fostering a culture of critical thinking, ethical reflection, and responsible innovation, we can ensure that AI is a tool that enhances, rather than replaces, human intelligence and creativity.

In the next chapter, we will explore some of the specific implications of AI for different aspects of academic life, from teaching and learning to research and innovation.

# Chapter 4: The Politics of Memory and the Rise of Cultural Violence in Serbia

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 was a platform for critical discourse on the interplay between culture, politics, and societal change. One of the most thought-provoking sessions was moderated by Vladimir Arsić, a prolific writer and cultural worker from Serbia. Arsić, also the president of the Crocodile Literary Festival, presented on the topic of "The Politics of Memory and the Rise of Cultural Violence in Serbia," delving into the complex dynamics of Serbian society's engagement with its past and the escalation of extremist sentiment.

## The Ghost of War and the Denial of Genocide

Arsić began by discussing the lingering effects of the Yugoslav Wars and the ongoing denial of genocide committed against Bosniaks and other non-Serb populations. He highlighted the recent UN General Assembly resolution on genocide recognition, where Serbia abstained, despite a majority of countries voting in favor. This, Arsić argued, was indicative of Serbia's persistent unwillingness to confront its dark past.

Arsić also touched upon the recent assassination attempt of Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, comparing it to the assassinations of Serbian Prime Ministers Zoran Đinđić (2003) and Ivan Stambolić (2000). He noted that while Vučić's attempted murder was widely condemned, the political climate in Serbia remained deeply divided, with many still supporting radical nationalist narratives.

## The Normalization of Toxic Murals and Graffiti

A significant portion of Arsić's presentation focused on the normalization of toxic murals and graffiti in Serbia, particularly on the streets of Belgrade. He presented examples of graffiti glorifying war criminals like Ratko Mladić and Radovan Karadžić, as well as supremacist symbols and hate speech targeting LGBTQ+ individuals and other minority groups.

Arsić discussed a particular mural of Mladić on Neosa Street, central Belgrade, which has been repeatedly defaced and repainted since 2021. He described the evolution of the mural, from its initial appearance to its recent iteration, featuring a stencil of Vladimir Putin's face intertwined with Serbian and Russian flags.

## The School Shooting and the Far Right's Rise

Arsić then shifted his focus to the recent school shooting in May 2023, where a 13-year-old boy opened fire on his school, killing seven students and a guard. He noted that the shooter was a fan of the Serbian football club Partizan, whose ultras are known for their far-right connections. Arsić argued that this event was not an isolated incident, but a symptom of a deeper societal issue: the rise of the far right in Serbia.

He presented data showing the proliferation of far-right murals and graffiti in Belgrade, many of which appeared after the school shooting. He also discussed the lack of response from Serbian authorities, suggesting a level of complicity or at least indifference.

## The Role of the Police and the State

Arsić also addressed the role of the police and the state in perpetuating this culture of violence. He spoke about the infiltration of far-right sympathizers within the police force and the security apparatus, as well as the state's failure to protect vulnerable populations.

He highlighted the case of a group of hooligans who were caught on camera assaulting a passerby in Belgrade, yet were protected by the police. Arsić argued that such incidents were not aberrations, but part of a broader pattern of state-sanctioned violence against progressive forces in Serbian society.

## The Spillover Effect and the Future of Serbia

Arsić concluded his presentation by discussing the spillover effect of Serbian politics on the rest of the Balkans. He argued that Serbia's failure to reckon with its past and address its present-day issues of extremism and violence would have repercussions throughout the region.

He posed a rhetorical question: "What does it say about a society when its police protect those who commit acts of violence, when its state apparatus sanctions hatred and extremism, and when its people stand by and watch as toxic narratives and symbols are normalized?"

Arsić's presentation sparked a lively debate among the panelists and the audience. While some criticized his approach as too pessimistic or lacking in nuance, others praised his willingness to confront difficult truths about Serbian society.

## The Ghost of War and the Denial of Genocide

The discussion around Arsić's presentation touched on a range of issues, from the denial of genocide to the normalization of toxic murals and graffiti in Serbia. One audience member, Ivan, asked about the spillover effect of Serbian politics on the rest of the Balkans. Arsić responded:

"Ivan, the spillover effect of Serbian politics on the rest of the Balkans is undeniable. Serbia's failure to address its past and tackle its present-day issues of extremism and violence will have repercussions throughout the region. We've seen this before, in the 1990s, when the wars in Yugoslavia had devastating consequences for the entire Balkans. If Serbia continues down this path, it's not just Serbia that will suffer, but the entire region."

## The Normalization of Toxic Murals and Graffiti

Another audience member, Zoran, asked about the normalization of toxic murals and graffiti in Serbia. Arsić replied:

"Zoran, the normalization of toxic murals and graffiti in Serbia is a symptom of a deeper societal issue. It's not just about the murals or the graffiti; it's about the hatred and extremism that they represent. As long as these toxic symbols are allowed to proliferate, as long as they're protected by the state and its apparatus, we'll continue to see an escalation of extremist sentiment in Serbian society."

## The Role of the Police and the State

A third audience member, Kristo, asked about the role of the police and the state in perpetuating this culture of violence. Arsić responded:

"Kristo, the role of the police and the state in perpetuating this culture of violence is crucial. We've seen time and again how the police, who are supposed to protect and serve the public, have instead protected those who commit acts of violence. We've seen how the state, through its policies and its indifference, has sanctioned hatred and extremism. Until we address this complicity, until we hold those accountable who are meant to protect us but instead protect those who would do us harm, we'll continue to see this culture of violence flourish."

## The Spillover Effect and the Future of Serbia

Finally, a fourth audience member, Oana, asked about the future of Serbia given these dynamics. Arsić replied:

"Oana, the future of Serbia depends on whether we, as a society, have the courage to confront our past and address our present-day issues. If we continue to deny our past, if we continue to allow hatred and extremism to flourish, if we continue to stand by and watch as our state apparatus sanctions violence, then the future of Serbia is bleak. But if we, as a society, have the courage to stand up and say 'No more,' then there's hope. There's hope that we can break this cycle of violence and extremism and build a more peaceful, more just society."

Arsić's presentation and the subsequent discussion highlighted the complex interplay between culture, politics, and societal change in Serbia. As the country continues to grapple with its past and its present-day challenges, the questions raised in this session remain pressing and relevant. The future of Serbia, and indeed the entire Balkans, hangs in the balance.


## Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024: Kadri Liik

# Futures Annual Symposium 2024: Russia - A Clicks and Whispers Panel

## Introduction

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 hosted a compelling panel discussion on Russia, titled "Russia - A Clicks and Whispers Panel". Moderated by Tom Deval, the panel comprised Kadri Liik, Gregory Mikov, and Rosa Di Felice, who delved into the complexities and uncertainties surrounding Russia's future. This chapter captures the essence of their conversation, offering insights into the historical trajectory of Russia, the impact of the Perestroika era, and the challenges of predicting Russia's future.

## The Enigmatic Nature of Russia's History

Tom Deval opened the panel by acknowledging the unpredictable nature of Russia's history, stating that it "never go[es] straight line". He drew parallels between the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union and the unexpected rebellion of the 1990s, emphasizing that Russia's trajectory is never linear. Kadri Liik, a Russia expert, echoed this sentiment, noting that Russia's history is marked by sudden and dramatic changes, such as the unexpected rise of Vladimir Putin.

### Kadri Liik's Personal Journey and Perspective on Russia

Liik traced her fascination with Russia back to her youth in Estonia, where she first visited Moscow in 1987. Her experiences and conversations with Russians during the late Soviet era shaped her understanding of Russia's political instincts and its complex relationship with the West. Liik observed that Russia often behaves in ways contrary to her expectations, leading her to question her assumptions and seek a deeper understanding of the country.

Liik chose to focus her fellowship research on the Perestroika era, a recent and tumultuous period in Russian history that is often overlooked in favor of the linear struggle between communism and democracy. She aimed to explore the fluid and creative nature of this time, when rules could change from day to day, and to challenge the Western narrative of Russia's transition from a totalitarian state to a democratic republic.

## The Impact of Perestroika on Russian Society and Politics

The panelists discussed the profound impact of Perestroika on Russian society and politics. Liik, who interviewed various figures from this era, noted that the societal ferment and optimism of Perestroika gave way to a sense of disillusionment and pessimism following the collapse of the Soviet Union. This disillusionment paved the way for Putin's rise to power and his consolidation of the Russian state.

### The Role of Technocrats in Putin's Russia

Rosa Di Felice, another panelist, raised the question of whether Putin's regime could survive a failing economy, given that the Perestroika era showed that even a failing economy could not topple the Soviet Union. Liik responded that Putin's regime is more resilient than that of the Soviet Union, as it is supported by a network of technocrats who are skilled in managing the economy and maintain a strong sense of loyalty to Putin.

However, Liik and Di Felice agreed that Putin's regime is not invincible, and that a combination of internal and external pressures could potentially challenge its power. They expressed concern about the passivity of Russian society, which they attributed to the regime's selective repression and the targeting of individuals who express dissenting opinions.

### The Future of Russia: Uncertainty and Unpredictability

The panelists emphasized the uncertainty and unpredictability of Russia's future. Liik suggested that Russia may be returning to a historical pattern of autocratic rule, but she also acknowledged that this trajectory could be disrupted by unforeseen events, such as a leadership succession crisis or a major economic crisis.

Di Felice echoed this sentiment, noting that Russia's future is uncertain and that the country could potentially experience a disintegration similar to that of the Soviet Union. However, she also recognized that Russia today is different from the Soviet Union of the late 1980s, with a more cohesive elite and a stronger state apparatus.

## The Role of History in Understanding Russia's Future

The panelists discussed the importance of understanding Russia's history in order to predict its future. Liik, who conducted interviews with Russian sociologists and academics, noted that there is a growing interest in history among Russians, as evidenced by the increasing number of history books and television shows that explore Russia's past.

However, Liik also observed that the Russian state is actively engaged in shaping the historical narrative, using history as a tool to justify its actions and maintain its power. Di Felice agreed, noting that the Putin regime has employed history as a weapon, using it to create a sense of national unity and to justify its aggressive foreign policy.

### The Need for a Nuanced Understanding of Russia's History

Liik and Di Felice emphasized the need for a nuanced and critical understanding of Russia's history, noting that the historical narrative promoted by the Russian state is selective and often misleading. They suggested that a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of Russia's past could provide valuable insights into the country's future.

## The Impact of Transnational Politics on Russia's Future

The panelists also discussed the impact of transnational politics on Russia's future. Liik noted that the transnational dimension of politics played a significant role in the Perestroika era, with ideas and influences flowing across borders. She suggested that the transnational aspect of politics could become more important in the future, as Russia seeks to assert its power and influence in the global arena.

Di Felice agreed, noting that Russia's future will be shaped by its interactions with other countries and international organizations. She expressed concern about the potential for Russia to become a dangerous and unpredictable actor on the global stage, given its aggressive foreign policy and its possession of nuclear weapons.

## Conclusion

The "Russia - A Clicks and Whispers Panel" offered a rich and nuanced exploration of Russia's history, politics, and future. The panelists emphasized the uncertainty and unpredictability of Russia's trajectory, noting that the country's past is marked by sudden and dramatic changes. They also highlighted the importance of understanding Russia's history in order to predict its future, and the need for a critical and balanced perspective on the country's past.

The panelists expressed concern about the potential for Russia to become a more assertive and unpredictable actor on the global stage, noting the importance of transnational politics in shaping Russia's future. They also acknowledged the challenges of predicting Russia's trajectory, given the country's complex and often contradictory dynamics.

In the end, the panelists offered no easy answers or neat predictions about Russia's future. Instead, they provided a thoughtful and engaging exploration of the country's history, politics, and uncertainties, inviting listeners to grapple with the complexities and challenges of understanding Russia's trajectory.

# The Rise of Far Right Populism in Slovakia: An Insider's Perspective

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 kicked off with a thought-provoking panel discussion on the rise of far right populism in Slovakia, moderated by **Alida Raic**, a prominent commentator. The panelists, **Peter Kco**, **Gia Me Nikov**, and **Robert Fico**, provided unique insights into the political landscape of Slovakia, with a particular focus on the assassination attempt on then-Prime Minister Robert Fico in 2018 and its aftermath.

## The Political Context

Slovakia, a small Central European country, has witnessed a shift towards far right politics in recent years. Peter Kco set the stage by noting that the assassination attempt on Fico was not an isolated incident but rather a symptom of a broader trend: "This event was not an act of an isolated lunatic, but a dramatic event that has far-reaching consequences for the political landscape in Slovakia."

Gia Me Nikov, a political analyst, delved into the underlying factors contributing to this trend. She highlighted the polarization of Slovak society into two main political camps: the national populist parties, including the Slovak National Party (SNS) and the People's Party – Our Slovakia (ĽS-N), and the liberal democratic parties, such as the Ordinary People and Independent Personalities (OĽaNO) and Progressive Slovakia (PS). This polarization has been exacerbated by the government's handling of the assassination attempt and its aftermath.

## The Assassination Attempt and Its Aftermath

Robert Fico, the target of the assassination attempt and a key figure in the subsequent political developments, recounted the events leading up to the attack. He described the political climate at the time, characterized by a "blame game" between the ruling coalition and the opposition. The ruling coalition, a center-right coalition led by the Ordinary People and Independent Personalities (OĽaNO) party, accused the opposition of contributing to the atmosphere that led to the assassination attempt. Fico, however, dismissed these allegations as baseless.

The assassination attempt marked a turning point in Slovak politics. Fico stepped down as Prime Minister, and the government collapsed. A new government, led by Igor Matovič, was formed, but it proved to be chaotic and ineffective. Matovič's approval ratings plummeted, and Fico saw an opportunity to return to power. However, his return was not met with universal acclaim. As Nikov noted, "While some people welcomed his return as a sign of stability, others saw it as a sign of a return to the old ways, a return to the politics of confrontation and polarization."

## The Rise of the Far Right

The rise of the far right in Slovakia can be traced back to the 2016 elections, when the Slovak National Party (SNS), a nationalist party with roots in the far right, entered the government. The party, led by the controversial figure Andrej Danko, had previously been considered an "anti-system" party, but it had moderated its positions to gain access to power. However, its presence in the government did little to halt the rise of even more extremist parties, such as the People's Party – Our Slovakia (ĽS-N), led by the charismatic Marian Kotleba.

Kotleba, a former skinhead and neo-Nazi, has successfully tapped into the discontent of the Slovak electorate. His party's platform, which includes a mix of nationalist, anti-immigrant, and anti-establishment rhetoric, has resonated with many Slovaks. As Kco noted, "Kotleba's party has managed to attract voters from both the left and the right, from the urban and the rural areas, from the young and the old. He has tapped into a deep well of discontent and frustration in Slovakia."

## The Role of the Media and Civil Society

The panelists also discussed the role of the media and civil society in Slovakia's political landscape. Fico, in particular, was critical of the media's coverage of the assassination attempt and its aftermath. He accused the media, particularly the public broadcaster RTVS, of bias and of contributing to the atmosphere of confrontation and polarization. He also noted that civil society had been unable to act as a check on the government's power, citing the example of the 70-year-old poet who confessed to the assassination attempt.

Nikov, however, offered a more nuanced view. She noted that while the media and civil society had faced challenges in holding the government accountable, they had also played a crucial role in mobilizing opposition to the government's attempts to erode democratic norms and institutions. She cited the massive protests that followed the government's attempt to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Fico as an example of civil society's ability to push back against authoritarian tendencies.

## The European Context

The panelists also placed Slovakia's political developments in a broader European context. Kco noted that the rise of far right populism in Slovakia was part of a wider trend across Europe. He cited the examples of Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, and Viktor Orbán in Hungary as evidence of this trend.

Nikov, however, sounded a note of caution. She noted that while the far right had made significant gains in recent years, there were also signs of a pushback against their influence. She cited the example of the European Union's migration policy, which had been toughened under pressure from the far right, but which had also been criticized by center-right and even some center-left parties. She also noted that the far right's influence on European policy-making was limited by the need to secure the support of other parties in the European Parliament.

## The Future of Slovak Politics

The panelists offered differing views on the future of Slovak politics. Fico was optimistic about his party's prospects in the upcoming elections, noting that it had maintained its support despite the chaos of the previous government. Kco, however, was more cautious, noting that while the far right had made significant gains, they were still a minority in Slovakia. Nikov, meanwhile, sounded a note of warning, noting that the rise of the far right was part of a longer-term trend towards polarization and confrontation in Slovak politics.

As the panelists noted, the rise of far right populism in Slovakia is not an isolated phenomenon but part of a broader trend across Europe. As such, understanding the political developments in Slovakia can provide valuable insights into the challenges facing democratic institutions and norms across the continent. The assassination attempt on Robert Fico in 2018 was not an isolated incident but a symptom of a deeper political crisis in Slovakia. As the country heads towards elections in 2024, the panelists' insights offer a critical perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing Slovak politics.

# Chapter 7: Harnessing Citizen Assemblies to Strengthen Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe

The seventh session of the Futures Annual Symposium 2024 kicked off with a notable deviation from the usual format, signaling a shift in focus towards more inclusive and participatory approaches to democracy. The speaker, whose name was difficult to pronounce, took the stage to address the pressing issue of mistrust in democratic institutions and the rise of authoritarian tendencies in the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region. Their presentation centered around the potential of citizen assemblies to bridge divisions within democratic societies and address geopolitical instability.

## The Case for Citizen Assemblies in CEE

The speaker began by sharing their personal journey, from growing up in independent Lithuania to working with Democracy Next, an NGO dedicated to designing and advising on citizen assemblies. They argued that citizen assemblies, a form of deliberative democracy, could help address the authoritarian tendencies in the CEE region.

Citizen assemblies, as explained by the speaker, bring together a representative group of citizens to deliberate on specific policy issues, learn from experts, and develop recommendations for policymakers. This process differs from traditional participatory democracy, which focuses on breadth of participation, and instead prioritizes depth of participation to ensure that those who would not otherwise participate have a say in decision-making processes.

The speaker presented a stark diagnosis of the democratic landscape in CEE. They pointed out that internal power capture, foreign interference, and democratic erosion were significant threats to democracy in the region. These challenges were exacerbated by the weakness of young democratic institutions, limited citizen engagement, and a hierarchical political culture that limited the agency of citizens.

## The Benefits of Citizen Assemblies in CEE

Despite these challenges, the speaker argued that citizen assemblies could still play a crucial role in strengthening democracy in CEE. They identified two main benefits:

1. **Building Resilient Democratic Systems**: Citizen assemblies could help build resilience in democratic systems by opening avenues for citizen participation and demonstrating that citizen input is valuable in decision-making processes. This could help prevent techniques designed to fracture and divide societies, such as divisive issues being weaponized by populists.

2. **Reducing Misinformation and Disinformation**: Citizen assemblies could help reduce misinformation and disinformation by presenting evidence from various experts and raising the quality of public debate. This was illustrated by the example of the Irish citizen assembly on abortion, which led to a referendum prohibiting abortion.

## Examples of Citizen Assemblies in CEE

The speaker cited several examples of citizen assemblies in CEE, noting a small deliberative wave emerging in the region since 2016. They mentioned assemblies in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine, and Poland, as well as local-level assemblies in Hungary. Many of these assemblies addressed environmental issues, reflecting global trends.

One notable example was the climate citizen assembly in Poland, which involved 550 citizens deliberating on climate change and developing recommendations for local authorities. This assembly was funded by the European Parliament and Council of Europe, demonstrating how international institutions could support democratization efforts in the region.

## Challenges and Criticisms

The speaker acknowledged several challenges and criticisms of citizen assemblies. These included securing political commitment in hierarchical political cultures, securing resources for assemblies, and preventing participation from being a 'washing' of existing policy decisions. They also noted the risk of assemblies being hijacked by populists in a dystopian scenario.

In response to these criticisms, the speaker offered several suggestions. They proposed that assemblies should be embedded within a systemic change within democracy, with recommendations taken forward and implemented. They also suggested that assemblies should be organized in a way that ensures cross-partisan support and protects against hijacking.

## A Path Towards Democratic Innovation

The speaker concluded by outlining a path towards democratic innovation. They suggested that assemblies should be seen as part of a toolbox of democratic innovations, rather than a silver bullet. They argued that assemblies should be designed with care, ensuring that they are impartial, well-organized, and protect the identity and data of participants.

The speaker also emphasized the importance of international collaboration in supporting and spreading democratic innovations. They noted that EU funding had been crucial in supporting assemblies in the CEE region, and that sharing best practices and resources could help overcome barriers to organizing assemblies.

## Q&A Session

Following the presentation, the floor was opened for questions and comments. The speaker engaged in a lively discussion with the audience, addressing topics such as the potential for assemblies to avoid being hijacked by populists, the role of expertise in deliberation, and the relationship between assemblies and representative democracy.

The speaker also discussed the potential for assemblies to address divisive issues, such as the conflict in Ukraine, and the need to balance representation with deliberation. They argued that assemblies could help build resilience in democratic systems by involving people in decision-making processes and fostering a sense of responsibility for democracy.

## Conclusion

The session closed with a summary of the key points and a thank you to the speaker. The discussion highlighted the potential of citizen assemblies to strengthen democracy in the CEE region, particularly in the face of authoritarian tendencies and geopolitical instability. The speaker's insights into the design and implementation of assemblies, as well as their acknowledgment of the challenges and criticisms of this democratic innovation, provided a comprehensive overview of the topic. The lively Q&A session further enriched the discussion, demonstrating the interest and engagement of the audience in this crucial topic.

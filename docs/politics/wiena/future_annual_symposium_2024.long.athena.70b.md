### The PK Memorial Lecture: Reflections on Global Politics and Europe's Role

In this timely and thought-provoking PK Memorial Lecture, esteemed diplomat and scholar Wan Petri shares his insightful analysis of the current geopolitical landscape, underscoring the imperative for Europe to redefine its position in an increasingly multipolar world. As we navigate the complexities of contestation, Petri's remarks offer a rich tapestry of historical context, astute observations, and forward-looking prescriptions for collective action.

#### Introduction and Tribute

> "I'm particularly honored to give this third PK Memorial Lecture... I hope to share... I spare details, simply saying Wan Petri is a well-distinguished senior Austrian diplomat, having held many significant high-level positions... Notably, as International High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina (1999-2002) and Ambassador to Belgrade (1997-1999)... I'll stop, giving a sweeping overview of the current geopolitical situation, titled 'Contestation and New Dynamics Driving Global Politics'."

Petri's introductory remarks pay homage to the legacy of PK, underscoring the importance of mutual understanding and respect in international relations. His personal anecdote about visiting the Palace of Vienna, where he saw PK's room, poignantly captures the human dimension of diplomatic endeavors.

#### Geopolitical Shifts and Europe's Imperative

> "When I prepared this lecture, I decided to go back to an academic paper... Olaf Scholz, German Chancellor, already in 2020, proclaimed a new epochal tectonic shift... Avoiding a new Cold War, [and] entering a multipolar era... Europe's recent history... reminds us that the implosion of Yugoslavia was a precursor to transformative change... Territorial and geopolitical, yet to come."

Petri masterfully weaves together threads from recent European history, highlighting the significance of Croatia's location, the dissolution of Yugoslavia, and the ongoing struggle to define Europe's role in a rapidly shifting world order. He astutely references Timothy Garton Ash's opinion piece, "Is this the new Cold War?", and the French president's vision for a "sovereign, autonomous Europe."

#### The Erosion of Liberal Democracy and the Rise of Nationalism

> "I'm still talking... Macron referred to... Europe's actual, acute fragility... The French president... convinced that nothing less than swift decisions will maintain European civilization... unless [it] maintains swift decisions... countering threats to security... and prosperity... obviously, Russia and China... human values, clearing the way for country-specific populist nationalism."

Petri's nuanced examination of Europe's predicament emphasizes the alarming erosion of liberal democratic values, the resurgence of nationalism, and the imperative for collective action to counter threats from Russia and China. He quotes Macron's warning that Europe's very survival depends on swift, decisive action.

#### The Paradox of Technological Progress and Growing Inequality

> "Zigmund Bauman... analyzes... the reason for sudden nostalgia... [the] lost ability of nation-states to promise prosperity and security... globalized world... sense of uncertain belonging... many feeling vulnerability... borderless world... 1989, clear-cut, dangerous divide... East-West... ideological competition... [now] fragile, yet productive, year... Taun, East-West, [and] dangerous moment... superpower confrontation."

Petri delves into the paradox of breathtaking technological progress alongside growing inequality, citing Bauman's work on nostalgia and the nation-state's lost promise of prosperity and security. He masterfully juxtaposes the post-1989 era of ideological competition with today's fragile, interconnected world, where superpower confrontations loom large.

#### The Emergence of Middle Powers and Global Governance

> "Take, for example, India... majoritarian Hindu nationalism... [and] Turkey, India, Brazil, Egypt... gaining traction, influence... regional power brokers... whether BRICS succeeds... new, rather recent development... group of assertive middle powers... [and] increasingly questioning Western-dominated... United Nations system... post-World War II setup... win-win formula, multilateralism... core UN system, eroded... transactional politics."

Petri's analysis extends to the rise of middle powers, exemplified by India, Turkey, Brazil, and Egypt, which are redefining regional governance and challenging Western-dominated institutions. He underscores the imperative for reforming the UN system, built on multilateralism and cooperation, rather than transactional politics.

#### Europe's Role in Shaping the Future

> "Europe... find [its] role... emerging multipolar world... avoid confrontive... China, America... preoccupied with war... Ukraine, Middle East... global inequality... [and] tackle climate migration... increasingly interconnected... Rare Earth... [and] artificial intelligence... [Europe] already a global player... December last, set... global president, adopting AI act... signal broader trend... responsive AI policy... regulatory leadership."

Petri concludes by emphasizing Europe's unique opportunity to navigate the triple challenge of territorial contestation, climate finance, and normative contestation. He advocates for Europe to adopt a novel mental map, recognizing its power in shaping global norms, and cites the EU's pioneering efforts in AI regulation as a beacon of leadership.

#### Conclusion

> "I commentariat, academia, [and] media... provided two forces... many challenges... [but] take... different world seriously... faith [in] predetermined vein... evening spiritus Rector... propose... take... institutional arrangement... fellow friends... view world fully cognizant... enormity task... imbued spirit... going forward... uncharted waters... 'unexpected expected'... thank... thank... attending... next step."

Petri's impassioned closing remarks urge us to confront the enormity of our task, to approach the uncharted waters of global politics with faith, and to institutionalize arrangements that foster collective action. As we navigate the complexities of contestation, his PK Memorial Lecture serves as a clarion call to reinvigorate Europe's spirit, reorient its role, and forge a brighter future for generations to come. The audience's applause resonates as a testament to the timeliness and profundity of Petri's vision, inspiring us to embark on this critical journey together.

**Rethinking European Democracy: A Video Conference on Participatory Governance**
=====================================================

### Introduction

In an era of increasing interconnectedness, the boundaries of traditional nation-states are being redefined. The European Union, a beacon of transnational cooperation, faces unprecedented challenges in fostering democratic participation and accountability. A recent video conference brought together esteemed experts to deliberate on the future of European democracy, yielding a rich tapestry of insights and proposals. This chapter transcribes and synthesizes the key discussions, offering a comprehensive exploration of participatory governance in the European context.

### The Perils of Technocratic Governance

Alberto, a renowned scholar, set the tone by highlighting the disconnect between European institutions and their citizens. "The EU has become a technocratic project, neglecting the democratic deficit that has plagued it since its inception." He cited the European Commission's lack of accountability, exemplified by the absence of a direct electoral connection between citizens and their representatives. This critique resonated with Rosa, who noted that even well-intentioned initiatives, such as the European Citizens' Initiative, have been underutilized, with only 200,000 signatories in 10 years. The panel concurred that the EU's legitimacy hinges on bridging this gap between citizens and institutions.

### The Promise of Transnational Lists

Stefan posed a provocative question: "Why not create a transnational list, bypassing national electoral systems?" This sparked a lively debate. Alberto countered that, while appealing, such an approach would require a radical overhaul of existing treaties and electoral laws. Rosa, however, saw merit in synchronizing national elections, facilitating a more cohesive European political space. The discussion underscored the tension between innovative solutions and the inertia of established institutions.

### Rethinking Accession and Membership

Ian suggested that democratization could offer an opportunity to rethink EU membership and accession. "Why not require candidate countries to hold referendums, capturing citizen sentiment on EU membership?" This sparked a broader examination of the relationship between national sovereignty and supranational governance. Felix noted that a participatory dimension to accession could revitalize the accession process, while Boris cautioned against cherry-picking benefits, highlighting the importance of subsidiarity in allocating competencies between local, national, and EU levels.

### The Power of Participatory Tools

Rosa emphasized the potential of participatory tools, such as citizen assemblies, to reinvigorate democratic engagement. "These initiatives can create a sense of ownership, fostering a deeper connection between citizens and the EU." Alberto concurred, citing the success of Iceland's crowdsourced constitution. The panel agreed that such innovations could revitalize the EU's democratic fabric, provided they are carefully integrated into existing institutional frameworks.

### The Challenge of Representation

A nuanced discussion on representation emerged, with Stefan questioning the efficacy of national electoral systems in producing truly European representatives. "Do MEPs truly represent Europe or their national constituencies?" Rosa responded by advocating for a mixed system, combining national and transnational lists to ensure diverse representation. The debate underscored the complexities of reconciling national sovereignty with supranational governance.

### Conclusion

This video conference distilled the essence of European democracy's predicament: the imperative to reconcile technocratic efficiency with participatory legitimacy. As the EU navigates an uncertain future, the insights shared here offer a beacon of hope. By embracing innovative participatory tools, reexamining accession and membership, and fostering a culture of subsidiarity, the EU can reinvigorate its democratic core. As Rosa aptly concluded, "The tanker of democracy must survive; let us gather at the table, appetite intact, to forge a more resilient, participatory Europe." The path ahead will be arduous, but the collective wisdom of this video conference illuminates a promising trajectory for European democracy.

### The Rise of Far-Right Politics and Russian Aggression: A Video Conference Insight

As the world grapples with the complexities of modern politics, a recent video conference brought together esteemed experts to dissect the intricate relationships between far-right ideologies, Russian aggression, and their impact on European politics. This chapter delves into the thought-provoking discussion, weaving together the diverse perspectives of the panelists to create a rich tapestry of insights.

#### Setting the Stage: The Interplay of Far-Right Politics and Russian Aggression

Hannah, the session's moderator, kicked off the conversation by highlighting the crucial role of far-right parties in responding to Russian aggression, particularly in the context of the Ukrainian war. She posed a pivotal question: "How do far-right parties react to Russian aggression, and what are the implications for European politics?" This inquiry served as the catalyst for a nuanced exploration of the interplay between these two forces.

#### Ideological Proximity and Russian Influence

The first panelist, Balash, underscored the significance of ideological proximity between far-right parties and Russia. He argued that these parties often share anti-Western, anti-liberal values, which Russia exploits to further its own interests. This common ground facilitates Russian infiltration and influence, enabling the Kremlin to undermine liberal democracies from within. Balash's remarks resonated deeply, as the group acknowledged the disturbing implications of such alliances.

#### The Power of Narrative and Hybrid Warfare

Next, Peter, an expert on far-right politics, emphasized the importance of narrative in shaping public perception. He contended that far-right parties effectively craft compelling narratives, capitalizing on fears and anxieties to mobilize support. Russia, too, has mastered this art, leveraging disinformation and hybrid warfare to sow discord and erode trust in liberal institutions. By recognizing the potency of narrative, Peter urged policymakers to develop counter-narratives that promote fact-based discourse and democratic values.

#### The Ukrainian War: A Catalyst for Far-Right Mobilization

Hannah shifted the focus to the Ukrainian war, asking how it has influenced far-right mobilization. A lively exchange ensued, with several panelists highlighting the war's role in polarizing societies and creating fertile ground for far-right recruitment. They noted that, by framing the conflict as an existential struggle against Russian imperialism, far-right parties can tap into a sense of urgency and moral clarity, attracting disillusioned voters who feel abandoned by mainstream politics.

#### The Dangers of Labeling and Elite Disconnection

A crucial thread emerged as the discussion turned to the perils of labeling and elite disconnection. Panelists cautioned against oversimplifying complex issues by reducing them to binary "far-right" or "pro-Russian" designations. Such labels can obscure nuanced understandings, alienate potential allies, and even inadvertently empower extremist voices. Instead, they advocated for nuanced, issue-specific engagement, acknowledging that mainstream elites' disconnection from grassroots concerns has created an opportunity for far-right parties to fill the void.

#### Case Studies and Contrasting Approaches

The conversation turned to specific case studies, illustrating diverse approaches to addressing far-right politics and Russian influence. Poland, with its strong anti-Russian sentiment, was contrasted with Italy, where a far-right party's anti- Ukrainian stance has garnered significant support. These examples underscored the importance of context-specific analysis, as well as the need for mainstream parties to reclaim ownership of key issues, such as national sovereignty and economic security, to counter far-right narratives.

#### The Imperative of Evidence-Based Policy and Mainstream Reengagement

Rosa, a seasoned political scientist, injected a note of urgency, stressing that policymakers must ground their decisions in empirical evidence rather than relying on anecdotal impressions. By doing so, they can develop targeted, effective strategies to counter far-right influence and Russian interference. Concurrently, mainstream parties must reengage with their electorates, revitalizing their connection to citizens and fostering inclusive, solutions-oriented discourse.

#### Conclusion: Beyond Binary Thinking

As the video conference drew to a close, the panelists' collective wisdom coalesced around a vital imperative: transcending binary thinking to forge a new politics of nuance, empathy, and fact-based engagement. By recognizing the intricate interplay between far-right ideologies and Russian aggression, and by embracing contextual, evidence-driven approaches, European politics can rediscover its liberal, democratic essence. This nuanced, multidisciplinary dialogue serves as a beacon, illuminating the path toward a more resilient, inclusive, and enlightened political landscape.

### The Eerie Reflections of a Balkan City: A Lived Experience of Toxicity and Activism

In a poignant and deeply unsettling video conference, Vladimir, a seasoned activist and writer, took us on a journey through the dark underbelly of Belgrade, Serbia. His presentation, a masterclass in weaving together personal anecdotes, historical context, and stark visuals, painted a vivid picture of a city suffocating under the weight of toxic nationalism, far-right extremism, and the echoes of genocide.

#### The Neosa Street Mural: A Canvas of Hatred

Vladimir's narrative began with the Neosa Street mural, a potent symbol of the city's poisoned atmosphere. This graffiti, glorifying war criminals and perpetuating a culture of violence, was not an isolated incident but rather a symptom of a broader disease. The presenter's own experiences, from witnessing the desecration of a primary school to the retaliatory actions of far-right groups, underscored the urgent need for collective action.

### The Intersections of History, Politics, and Violence

Vladimir astutely linked the current state of affairs to the region's tumultuous past, particularly the Yugoslav Wars and the subsequent denial of genocide. He emphasized how this denial, coupled with the manipulation of historical narratives, had fostered a climate of victimization and the production of enemies. The consequences were stark: a mainstreaming of extremist ideologies, a blurring of lines between state institutions and far-right groups, and a perpetuation of violence.

#### The Power of Memorialization and its Distortions

The presenter delved into the complexities of memorialization, highlighting how it could either promote reconciliation or reinforce divisions. In Serbia, a distorted narrative had taken hold, with textbooks and public discourse often masquerading as historical truth. This, Vladimir argued, was a crucial factor in the radicalization of youth and the entrenchment of toxic attitudes.

### The Personal Cost of Activism and the Importance of Collective Action

Interspersed throughout the presentation were personal vignettes, offering a glimpse into the human toll of activism. Vladimir shared stories of colleagues attacked, of harassment, and of the psychological burden of confronting hate. These moments of vulnerability underscored the imperative of collective action, of building a broad, inclusive coalition to counterbalance the forces of hatred.

#### The Institute and the Power of Counternarratives

The Institute, a beacon of hope, exemplified an alternative path. Through initiatives like the "Free Street" project, which reclaimed public spaces from hate graffiti, and its promotion of restorative justice, the organization demonstrated that counternarratives could be crafted and amplified. By engaging with, rather than dismissing, the complexities of the past, a more inclusive, empathetic Serbia could begin to take shape.

### The Spillover Effect and the Imperative of Regional Solidarity

Vladimir's experiences, though deeply rooted in Belgrade, resonated across the Balkans. The spillover effect, whereby toxic ideologies and violent tactics crossed borders, demanded a regional response. By recognizing the interconnectedness of their struggles, activists from Bosnia, Croatia, and beyond could forge a united front, sharing knowledge, strategies, and hope.

#### Confronting the Mirror: A Call to Action

As the presentation drew to a close, Vladimir issued a searing challenge: to confront the mirror, to acknowledge the darkness that lurked within, and to commit to a journey of self-reflection and collective transformation. This was not a call to arms, but a plea for empathy, for the courage to listen, and for the will to rebuild. As we, the audience, gazed upon the digital reflection of Belgrade's troubled landscape, we were reminded that the true power of video conferencing lay not in the technology itself, but in its capacity to bridge distances, to forge empathy, and to inspire a chorus of voices demanding a better, more just, and more compassionate world.

In the end, Vladimir's testament to the human spirit, forged in the crucible of Belgrade's darkness, illuminated a beacon of hope. It reminded us that, even in the most forsaken of places, activism, collective action, and the unwavering pursuit of truth could conjure a brighter, more inclusive, and more resilient future – one that would ultimately redefine the very fabric of our shared humanity. As we disconnected from the virtual conference room, the echoes of Vladimir's words lingered, an indelible reminder of the transformative power of lived experience, courage, and the unyielding pursuit of a better world.

### Reflections on Russia: A Video Conference Exploration

#### Introduction
On a crisp day, a diverse group of experts gathered for a video conference to dissect the complexities of Russia, its history, and its trajectory. The discussion was marked by candid reflections, insightful analyses, and nuanced debates, weaving a rich tapestry of perspectives. This chapter captures the essence of that engaging conversation, preserving the authenticity and immediacy of the live exchange.

#### Tom Deval's Provocation
Tom Deval, a seasoned observer of Russia, set the tone with a personal anecdote. "I started interested in Russia in the mid-1980s as a student in Estonia, and I kept going back. I noticed Russia didn't behave as expected, and I wanted to understand why." He recounted how his experiences, from witnessing the Baltic States' struggle for autonomy to observing the dynamics of Putin's rule, led him to ask: "Can Russia proceed in a straight line, or is it destined to repeat historical patterns?" This question framed the subsequent discussion, inviting participants to share their expertise and ponder the implications.

#### The Perils of Linear Progress
Gregori Mikov, a Russian-born scholar, responded by highlighting the non-linear nature of Russian history. "History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. The illusion of stability, followed by collapse, is a recurring theme." He cautioned against expecting a straightforward democratic transition, citing the Baltic States as catalysts for change, rather than models to be replicated. "Russia found it easier to function with a catalyst than to internalize democratic values." This nuanced understanding of Russia's trajectory sparked a lively exchange.

#### The Role of Technocrats and Intellectuals
Rosa Di, an economist, shifted the focus to the technocratic elite, arguing that their influence was crucial in both Soviet and post-Soviet eras. "In the 1990s, technocrats like Gaidar and Chubais played a key role in reforming the economy, but their efforts were undermined by Putin's consolidation of power." She contended that, even today, "people skilled in running the economy and informed about democratic values could demand change, but they're not heard." This assessment sparked a debate on the interplay between intellectuals, technocrats, and the ruling elite.

#### The Power of Negative Identity
Yuri Levada, a renowned sociologist, offered a sobering analysis. "Putin's regime relies on a negative identity, founded on a sense of threat from the West. This defensive posture has allowed him to consolidate power and discredit liberal ideals." He warned that "unless Russia develops a positive, inclusive narrative, it will remain mired in historical grievance." This insight resonated with the group, underscoring the need for a profound shift in Russia's self-perception.

#### Historical Memory and Its Manipulation
Ivana, a historian, delved into the manipulation of historical memory, a hallmark of Putin's strategy. "By selectively rewriting history, Putin justifies his actions and discredits dissenting voices. This 'memory war' is waged not only within Russia but also against neighboring countries." She emphasized that "challenging these narratives is crucial for Russia to move forward." The group concurred that an honest engagement with history, rather than its distortion, was essential for Russian society to mature.

#### The Imperative of International Cooperation
Gregori Mikov returned to the theme of transnational politics, stressing that "the Baltic States, particularly Estonia, showed that democratic reform is possible with international support." He advocated for cooperation, arguing that "Russia's trajectory will be shaped by its relationships with the West and its own civil society." This emphasis on collaboration and mutual understanding resonated, as participants acknowledged that Russia's future was inextricably linked to its engagement with the global community.

#### The Uncanny Parallels Between 1970s and Today
In a thought-provoking aside, Heather, an economist, drew parallels between the 1970s and contemporary Russia. "Both periods saw a leader trying to reform the economy, but Putin's efforts, like those of Brezhnev, are compromised by a reliance on war economies and a discredited Soviet heritage." This analogy sparked a rich discussion on the cyclical nature of Russian history, with participants pondering whether Putin's regime was, in fact, a reprise of past patterns.

#### The Interplay of Economy, History, and Politics
As the conversation drew to a close, Ivan Kristof, a journalist, synthesized the key threads. "Russia's economy, history, and politics are inextricably linked. To move forward, Russia must prioritize truth, transparency, and accountability, rather than relying on the toxic triumvirate of authoritarianism, nationalism, and historical revisionism." This concise summation distilled the essence of the video conference, underscoring the imperative for Russia to forge a new path, one that honors its complex heritage while embracing a more inclusive, democratic future.

#### Conclusion
This video conference, marked by its candor, erudition, and willingness to confront complexities, distilled the multifaceted essence of Russia. As participants parted ways, they carried with them a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between history, economy, and politics that shapes Russia's trajectory. The discussion, in its very structure, demonstrated that meaningful progress can arise from diverse perspectives, engaged dialogue, and a shared commitment to truth. As the world navigates the uncertainties of Russia's path forward, this conversation stands as a testament to the transformative power of informed, empathetic exchange. Ultimately, it is not the repetition of history that will define Russia's future, but the courage to forge a new, inclusive narrative that honors its past while embracing a brighter, more democratic horizon.

### Empowering Democratic Innovation: A Video Conference on Citizen Assemblies
=====================================================================

In this riveting video conference, a diverse group of experts convened to deliberate on the potential of citizen assemblies in strengthening democratic systems. The discussion was characterized by a rich exchange of ideas, critiques, and insights, underscoring the complexities and opportunities inherent in this innovative approach to participatory governance.

### Setting the Stage
---------------

The session began with a comprehensive introduction to citizen assemblies, highlighting their distinctiveness from other participatory methods. The presenter emphasized their potential in addressing democratic crises, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, where authoritarian tendencies and disinformation threaten democratic resilience. By bridging the gap between citizens and decision-makers, citizen assemblies can foster a deeper sense of agency, informed decision-making, and systemic trust.

### The Power of Deliberation
-------------------------

A key participant, Anana, underscored the significance of deliberation in distinguishing citizen assemblies from other participatory approaches. She stressed that these assemblies' focus on informed, depthful engagement – rather than mere consultation or aggregation of opinions – enables citizens to develop a shared understanding, identify common ground, and craft nuanced, evidence-based recommendations. This deliberative quality, Anana argued, is essential for generating impactful, long-term policy outcomes that transcend fleeting political cycles.

### Representation, Expertise, and Power
-----------------------------------

Heather posed a crucial question: Can citizen assemblies genuinely empower citizens, or do they risk being co-opted by populist or elite interests? She cautioned against overestimating the value of these assemblies, emphasizing that their success hinges on ensuring they remain connected to decision-making power, rather than merely serving as advisory bodies. Kristoff P. added that, to avoid manipulation, it is essential to institutionalize robust guidelines, such as those developed by the OECD, and to prioritize transparency, impartiality, and stakeholder representation.

### The Interplay between Representation and Deliberation
---------------------------------------------------

Ed responded by highlighting the interdependence of representation and deliberation. He argued that, in contrast to superficial, populist appeals, deliberative democracy fosters a deeper, more informed public sphere. By engaging with diverse expertise and perspectives, citizens develop a nuanced understanding of complex issues, ultimately informing more thoughtful, accountable decision-making. This, in turn, strengthens the legitimacy and responsiveness of representative institutions, as citizens become more empowered, active participants in shaping policy.

### Avoiding Hijacking and Ensuring Impact
-------------------------------------

Alberto raised concerns about the potential for citizen assemblies to be hijacked by special interests or populists. To mitigate this risk, he advocated for careful design, emphasizing the importance of:

1. **Transparency**: Ensuring openness in process, funding, and stakeholder engagement.
2. **Impartiality**: Safeguarding against capture by partisan or elite interests.
3. **Stakeholder representation**: Incorporating diverse, representative voices in assembly composition and deliberation.

By institutionalizing these safeguards, citizen assemblies can generate impactful, broadly supported policy recommendations that resist manipulation and promote systemic trust.

### Lessons from Practice: From Success to Scale
--------------------------------------------

Yeva shared insights from her experience with citizen assemblies, underscoring their potential to:

1. **Foster inclusive, informed decision-making**: By engaging citizens in depthful deliberation, assemblies can surface nuanced, context-specific solutions.
2. **Cultivate systemic trust**: Transparent, empowering processes can rebuild faith in democratic institutions and foster a sense of shared ownership.
3. **Scale impact**: Successful assemblies can inform, inspire, and inform policy reforms, ultimately reshaping the broader political landscape.

### The Path Forward: Institutionalizing Innovation
---------------------------------------------

As the conference concluded, participants reiterated the imperative to:

1. **Mainstream deliberative democracy**: Integrating citizen assemblies into existing institutional frameworks, enhancing representative democracy's responsiveness and accountability.
2. **Innovate within and beyond existing systems**: Developing hybrid approaches that blend the strengths of citizen deliberation with the legitimacy of representative institutions.
3. **Learn, adapt, and diffuse best practices**: Fostering a culture of continuous improvement, knowledge sharing, and cross-boundary collaboration to amplify the transformative potential of citizen assemblies.

This video conference distilled the essence of citizen assemblies' promise: by harnessing the collective wisdom of diverse, engaged citizens, we can forge a more resilient, responsive, and inclusive democracy. As we navigate the complexities of 21st-century governance, embracing deliberative, empowering approaches can unlock a brighter, more participatory future – one where citizens, empowered by informed deliberation, reclaim their rightful place at the heart of democratic decision-making.

### The Future of Academic Integrity: A Video Conference on AI, Democracy, and the University

In this pivotal video conference, a diverse group of scholars and experts convened to examine the intricate relationships between artificial intelligence, democracy, and the university. The discussion delved into the far-reaching implications of AI on academic integrity, critical thinking, and the very fabric of higher education.

#### Setting the Stage

The conference began with a thought-provoking presentation from Katy Hayward, Professor of Political Sociology at Queens University Belfast. She reflected on the disturbing convergence of AI-generated images and their potential to undermine academic authenticity. Hayward's poignant example of an AI-generated cover page, indistinguishable from human craftsmanship, raised essential questions about the role of discernment in academia. This sparked a rich exploration of the interplay between AI, intellectual responsibility, and the erosion of human thoughtfulness in the neoliberal university.

#### The Tyranny of Mediocrity

Hayward's remarks resonated deeply with the audience, as she critiqued the "tyranny of mediocrity" permeating modern academic culture. She identified four primary causes: the tyranny of mediocrity, pragmatism, measurability, and mercantilism. These forces, she argued, have led to the commodification of knowledge, the suppression of critical thinking, and the prioritization of convenience over profundity. The room was palpably moved by her impassioned plea for the university to reclaim its role in fostering discernment, depth, and democratic responsibility.

#### The Dangers of Unreflective Adoption

Luke Cooper, a fellow of the Europes Futures Fellowship, responded with a nuanced exploration of the consequences of uncritically embracing AI in academic settings. He cautioned that AI-assisted text generation, while potentially efficient, might further diminish the already scarce commodity of human thoughtfulness. Cooper's concerns echoed Hayward's warnings, underscoring the imperative for academics to thoughtfully integrate AI, rather than surrendering to its expediency. This exchange laid the groundwork for a probing examination of the ethical stakes involved in harnessing AI within higher education.

#### The Imperative of Critical Thinking

Sonia Biry, Professor of Philosophy and Culture at the Academy of Applied Arts, University of R, offered a compelling case for revitalizing liberal arts education as a bulwark against the perils of unreflective AI adoption. By cultivating critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness, Biry argued that academia could reclaim its democratic vocation and empower students to navigate the complexities of AI-driven societies. Her emphasis on the human component of discernment, rather than mere technical proficiency, resonated deeply with the assembled scholars.

#### The Pitfalls of Predictive Policing and Generative AI

A subsequent exchange, sparked by a comment from the audience, delved into the darker consequences of AI in predictive policing and generative AI. The discussion highlighted the risks of perpetuating biases, exacerbating social injustices, and furthering the erosion of trust in institutions. This somber exploration served as a poignant reminder of the pressing need for academics to engage in values-driven, critically informed AI development and implementation.

#### The University as a Site of Resistance

Alberto, a scholar from the University of Edinburgh, posed a vital question: How might academics mobilize against the imposition of AI models that imperil academic autonomy and exacerbate existing power imbalances? This query catalyzed a fervent discussion on the potential for collective action, trade union mobilization, and grassroots resistance within academia. The room was unanimous in its recognition that scholars must reclaim their agency in shaping the future of AI in higher education, rather than ceding authority to external forces.

#### The Intertwined Fates of AI, Democracy, and the University

As the conference drew to a close, the participants distilled the essence of their exchange: the intertwined fates of AI, democracy, and the university hang precariously in the balance. The imperative to reclaim academic integrity, foster critical discernment, and foreground human values in AI development and integration became crystal clear. This gathering served as a clarion call to scholars worldwide: only through collective, values-driven action can we ensure that AI, far from eroding democracy, becomes a potent catalyst for its revitalization within and beyond the university walls.

The morning's deliberations concluded with an unspoken yet resounding consensus: the future of academic integrity, democracy, and the university itself hinges on our capacity to thoughtfully harness AI, rather than surrendering to its expediency. As we part ways, the gravity of this challenge lingers, an open invitation to scholars, policymakers, and citizens alike to forge a more humane, more democratic, and more discerning relationship between AI, academia, and the world we inhabit. The stakes are high, yet the promise of collective action, critical discernment, and values-driven innovation beckons – an opportunity to reimagine the university as a beacon of democratic responsibility, illuminated by the interplay of human intelligence, artificial intelligence, and the unwavering pursuit of wisdom.

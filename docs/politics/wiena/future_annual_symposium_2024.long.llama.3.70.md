**The PK Memorial Lecture: Contestation and the New Dynamics of Global Politics**
============================================================

The PK Memorial Lecture, a special occasion to honor the legacy of a remarkable individual, was held via video conference. This chapter transcribes the lecture, which delves into the complexities of global politics and the challenges facing Europe in the modern era.

**Introduction**
---------------

The lecture began with a warm welcome from the host, who introduced the speaker, Wang Petri, a distinguished senior Austrian diplomat with an impressive career spanning many significant positions in the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Petri's wealth of experience includes serving as the International High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ambassador to Belgrade, and Permanent Representative of Austria to the United Nations in Geneva.

**The Legacy of PK**
-------------------

The host paid tribute to PK, a true intellectual and a passionate individual who played a crucial role in establishing the Institute for Human Sciences. PK's legacy is a testament to his dedication to fostering a deeper understanding of global politics and his commitment to promoting critical thinking.

**The Current Geopolitical Situation**
-----------------------------------

Wang Petri began his lecture by highlighting the tectonic shift in global politics, which has led to a new era of contestation and competition. He cited the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's address, which emphasized the need to avoid a new Cold War and to work towards a multipolar era. Petri noted that the recent aggression in Ukraine has irreversibly altered the nature of European integration, and that the French President Emmanuel Macron's vision for a sovereign and autonomous Europe is more relevant than ever.

**The Rise of Nationalism and Populism**
-------------------------------------

Petri discussed the resurgence of nationalism and populism, which has led to a decline in the liberal democratic space. He cited the example of Macron's pro-European program, which was initially met with skepticism but has since gained traction. The French President's emphasis on the need to maintain European sovereignty and to counter the threats to European security is a testament to the changing geopolitical landscape.

**The European Union and the Global Order**
-----------------------------------------

The lecture touched upon the European Union's role in the global order, with Petri highlighting the need for Europe to maintain its sovereignty and to navigate the triple challenge of territorial contestation, normative contestation, and political system contestation. He emphasized the importance of developing a new mental map of the world, one that recognizes the changing power dynamics and the need for Europe to adopt a more assertive stance in global politics.

**The Role of the Nation-State**
-----------------------------

Petri discussed the decline of the nation-state and the rise of supranational institutions, such as the European Union. He noted that the nation-state is slowly becoming irrelevant, with multinational corporations and digital startups exerting unprecedented influence over global governance. The lecture highlighted the need for a new regulatory framework that addresses the challenges posed by the digital revolution and globalization.

**The European Neighborhood Policy**
---------------------------------

Petri referenced the European Neighborhood Policy, which has been rendered obsolete by the recent aggression in Ukraine. He emphasized the need for Europe to develop a new policy framework that addresses the challenges posed by its neighborhood, including the need to recognize the changing power dynamics and to adopt a more assertive stance in global politics.

**Conclusion**
--------------

The PK Memorial Lecture provided a thought-provoking analysis of the current geopolitical situation and the challenges facing Europe. Wang Petri's lecture emphasized the need for Europe to adopt a new mental map of the world, one that recognizes the changing power dynamics and the need for a more assertive stance in global politics. As the world grapples with the complexities of contestation and competition, the lecture served as a timely reminder of the need for critical thinking and intellectual curiosity.

**Appendix**
-------------

The lecture was attended by a diverse group of participants, including policymakers, academics, and civil society representatives. The discussion that followed the lecture was lively and engaging, with participants posing thought-provoking questions and engaging in a substantive debate on the future of Europe and its role in the global order.

**Chapter 7: The European Project: A Video Conference on Democratic Innovation**

In this chapter, we present a transcript of a video conference that took place among experts and policymakers to discuss the future of the European project. The conference was focused on democratic innovation and the role of citizens in shaping the European Union's policies.

### Introduction

The European project has been at the forefront of international relations and global governance for decades. With the rise of nationalist and populist movements across the continent, the EU has faced numerous challenges to its legitimacy and effectiveness. In response, there has been a growing interest in democratic innovation and citizen engagement to revitalize the European project.

### The Video Conference

The video conference brought together a diverse group of experts, policymakers, and academics to discuss the future of the European project. The participants were from different backgrounds and countries, and they shared their experiences and perspectives on democratic innovation and citizen engagement.

### The Discussion

**Alberto**: Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that the European project is at a crossroads. We need to rethink the way we do things and find new ways to engage citizens in the decision-making process.

**Rosa**: I agree. The European Union has been criticized for being out of touch with its citizens. We need to find ways to make the EU more accountable and responsive to people's needs.

**Stefan**: I think one of the main challenges is the lack of a European public sphere. We need to create a space where citizens can engage with each other and with policymakers on a European level.

**Nicola**: I'd like to add that we need to focus on the local level. Citizens need to feel that their voices are being heard and that they have a stake in the European project.

**Felix**: I think we need to be careful not to romanticize the local level. We need to find ways to connect the local to the European level and create a sense of European citizenship.

**Gazela**: I'd like to add that we need to think about the role of technology in facilitating citizen engagement. We have the tools to connect citizens across borders, but we need to use them more effectively.

**Alberto**: I agree. Technology can play a crucial role in facilitating citizen engagement and making the EU more accountable. But we need to be careful not to rely too heavily on technology and forget about the importance of human interaction.

**Rosa**: I think we also need to think about the role of education in fostering a sense of European citizenship. We need to educate citizens about the EU and its policies, as well as promote critical thinking and media literacy.

**Stefan**: I'd like to add that we need to think about the role of civil society organizations in promoting citizen engagement and democratic innovation. They can play a crucial role in mobilizing citizens and promoting change.

**Nicola**: I think we also need to think about the role of the media in shaping public opinion and influencing policy debates. We need to promote high-quality journalism and critical reporting on EU policies.

**Felix**: I'd like to add that we need to think about the role of political parties in promoting democratic innovation. They need to be more open to citizen input and more transparent in their decision-making processes.

**Gazela**: I think we also need to think about the role of the European Parliament in promoting democratic innovation. It needs to be more proactive in engaging citizens and promoting transparency and accountability.

**Alberto**: I agree. The European Parliament has a crucial role to play in promoting democratic innovation and making the EU more accountable to its citizens.

### Conclusion

The video conference highlighted the need for democratic innovation and citizen engagement in the European project. The participants emphasized the importance of creating a European public sphere, promoting education and critical thinking, and using technology to facilitate citizen engagement. They also stressed the need for civil society organizations, the media, and political parties to play a more active role in promoting democratic innovation and making the EU more accountable to its citizens.

The discussion showed that there is a growing interest in democratic innovation and citizen engagement in the European project. However, it also highlighted the challenges and complexities involved in promoting change and making the EU more accountable to its citizens. Despite these challenges, the participants were optimistic about the potential for democratic innovation and citizen engagement to revitalize the European project and make it more responsive to people's needs.

### Recommendations

Based on the discussion, we recommend the following:

* Create a European public sphere to facilitate citizen engagement and promote a sense of European citizenship.
* Promote education and critical thinking about the EU and its policies.
* Use technology to facilitate citizen engagement and make the EU more accountable to its citizens.
* Encourage civil society organizations, the media, and political parties to play a more active role in promoting democratic innovation and making the EU more accountable to its citizens.
* Foster a culture of transparency and accountability within the EU institutions and promote citizen participation in the decision-making process.

By implementing these recommendations, we can promote democratic innovation and citizen engagement in the European project and make it more responsive to people's needs.

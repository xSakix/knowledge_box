## The Ghostwriter's Vision

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 was a special occasion, marking the Aart P. K. Memorial Lecture's fourth year. This lecture, named in honor of Aart P. K., a mentor, and friend to many, was always a part of the world's narrative, particularly in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. The speaker, a distinguished senior Austrian diplomat with significant experience in high-level positions at the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was slated to give an insightful lecture.

The speaker began by expressing his honor at being asked to give the lecture, noting that it was the first Iard Busek Memorial Lecture since the former Greek Prime Minister, George Papandreou, had given his in the previous year. The lecture was significant as it was the first time that Wang Petri, a renowned figure in Austrian diplomacy, had accepted such an engagement.

The speaker then gave a brief overview of Wang Petri's professional career, mentioning his positions as the International High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina (1995-2002), the Austrian Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva, and the President of the Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation. The speaker noted that it would take a long lecture to enumerate everything Wang Petri had done, but he simply wished to highlight his significant contributions to Austrian and global affairs.

The speaker then moved on to discuss the current geopolitical situation, titled "The Contestation: New Dynamics Driving Global Politics." He noted that the world was undergoing a tectonic shift, first proclaimed by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who had stated that Europe was in a multipolar era. The speaker quoted Scholz's essay, which referred to Europe's recent history and the need for swift decisions to counter threats to Europe's security, prosperity, and human values.

The speaker also mentioned the rise of nationalism and populism, the widening gap between the super-rich and the poor, and the increasing influence of non-Western countries. He noted that the world was in a precarious moment, with a devastating conflict in Ukraine, a triple planetary crisis, and skyrocketing inequality. The speaker concluded by stating that the world was in a new era of challenges on a truly planetary scale.

The speaker then turned to Europe's potential role in the emerging multipolar world. He noted that the European Union was a major player in global affairs, with its regulatory leadership in areas such as artificial intelligence. However, he also highlighted Europe's weaknesses, such as the need for deeper integration and the challenges posed by territorial contestation, climate finance, public debt, and tax regimes.

In conclusion, the speaker proposed that Europe needed to become a policy-consistent player and deal with the triple challenge of territorial contestation, normative contestation, and political actor contestation. He emphasized the need for a new mental map of the world to recognize the power of politics and the importance of shaping choices and partners or competitors.

The ghostwriter's vision provided a thought-provoking discussion of the current geopolitical situation and the potential role of Europe in the emerging multipolar world. The lecture highlighted the challenges facing Europe and the need for a policy-consistent approach to deal with these challenges. It was a fitting tribute to the memory of Aart P. K., a political activist and diplomat who had always been committed to shaping Europe's future.

# Chapter: Radicalization, Populism, and the Rise of Far-Right Parties: The Role of Ukrainian Refugees and Russian Influence

## The Symposium Discussion

### Introduction

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 featured a compelling discussion on the rise of far-right parties in Europe, the role of populism in political discourse, and the impact of the Ukrainian refugee crisis on mainstream political parties. The panel, moderated by Hannah Shelest, featured Peter Balash, an expert on political economy and international relations, and several other speakers who contributed to the discourse on the shifting political landscape in Europe.

### The Rise of Far-Right Parties

The panel began with a discussion on the rise of far-right parties in Europe. Panelists noted that these parties often share a fundamental anti-Western position and are often seen as a threat to liberal democracies. However, they also acknowledged that this is not a one-size-fits-all approach, as parties in countries like Poland and Hungary have shown strong pro-Ukrainian sentiments, complicating the narrative around these parties.

### Populism and the Role of Russia

The discussion then shifted to populism and its influence on both far-right and mainstream parties. It was noted that populism often uses fear and anti-immigration sentiments to gain support, and this was evident in the response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis. Interestingly, some far-right parties that were traditionally hostile to Russia have become more supportive of Ukraine since the invasion, showing a shift in their stance.

Peter Balash highlighted the role of Russian influence in shaping the narrative around the war in Ukraine. He mentioned an article that was accepted for publication which explored the idea that the invasion of Ukraine is a response to the US-led world order. This narrative is often pushed by far-right parties and has gained traction in Eastern Europe, such as in Hungary and Poland.

### The Impact of Ukrainian Refugees

The panel also touched on the impact of Ukrainian refugees on the political debate in Europe. In countries like Ireland, the warm welcome for Ukrainian refugees has been used to justify support for Ukraine. However, this has also led to an increase in anti-immigration sentiments and a sense of unfairness when it comes to supporting other refugees.

### Conclusion

The discussion concluded with an analysis of the future of these far-right parties and their potential influence on the political landscape. The panelists agreed that the invasion of Ukraine has acted as a uniting effect, bringing together different parties that were previously at odds. The Symposium ended with a call for more research into the complex and shifting political landscape of Europe, especially concerning the rise of far-right and far-left parties and the potential implications for the future of the European Union.

---

This chapter from the Futures Annual Symposium 2024 highlights the complex interplay between populism, the rise of far-right parties, and the impact of the Ukrainian refugee crisis on political debates across Europe. It underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the motivations behind these shifts and the potential long-term effects on the political landscape of the European Union. The discussion provides valuable insights into the evolving nature of political discourse and the factors driving the rise of these parties in a time of global crisis.

# Futures Annual Symposium 2024: Chapter on Slovakia's Political Landscape and Rising Far-Right

## The Symposium Session

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 featured a session focusing on the Slovak political landscape, the rise of the far-right, and the implications for the European Union and democracy. The panelists discussed the current state of Slovakia's institutions, the influence of far-right movements, and the potential future directions of the country. This chapter is based on the transcript of that session.

## Transcript Highlights

### Introduction

The session began with a video transcript discussing the current state of Slovakia. The speaker mentioned the assassination attempt on Slovak Prime Minister Fico, who had been accused of corruption. The far-right had been gaining ground in the country, and the ruling coalition blamed the opposition for the assassination attempt.

### Peter Fico and the Far-Right

Peter Fico, a populist and former prime minister, had been accused of corruption and mafia-like behavior. Despite this, Fico was motivated to stay in power and was seen as a potential Donald Trump figure in Slovakia. The speaker speculated that Fico's motivation to stay in power could be driven by a classical right-wing approach, with a focus on nationalism and anti-EU sentiment.

### Far-Right and Mainstream Parties

The far-right had been exploiting and amplifying the sentiment against the EU's green agenda and the interference in people's lives, such as wearing masks and getting vaccinated. This sentiment had been embraced by mainstream parties, which had seen a decline in support for green parties.

### Mainstream Parties and Far-Right

There was a growing sentiment that the mainstream parties were preemptively embracing far-right policies to gain support. The speaker mentioned that this was a common strategy in Eastern Europe.

### The Far-Right in Europe

Far-right parties were seen as a potential force in European Parliament elections, with 25 far-right members expected. The speaker speculated that the far-right would be divided, but that their presence in the European Parliament could lead to a significant change in functioning.

### Migration and Far-Right

The speaker mentioned that migration had been a focal point for far-right parties. However, countries like Hungary and Poland had opened their borders to workers from the Balkans, which was seen as a contradiction to their anti-immigrant stance.

### Institutions in Slovakia

The speaker discussed the role of institutions in Slovakia, focusing on the Constitutional Court, which had been colonized by the ruling coalition. There was a question of whether the Slovak institutions were capable of resisting far-right influence.

### Far-Right and Democracy

The speaker concluded that far-right parties were not necessarily successful, but that they were exploiting and amplifying issues that had been raised by mainstream parties. The far-right had been attacking mainstream parties and pushing them to the right.

## Conclusion

The session at the Futures Annual Symposium 2024 provided a detailed analysis of the political landscape in Slovakia. The rise of the far-right and the influence of Peter Fico were key themes, with the panelists discussing the implications for democracy and the European Union. The session concluded with a discussion of the resilience of Slovak institutions and the potential for far-right influence.

# Chapter: Democratic Innovation and Citizen Assemblies: Bridging the Divide in Democratic Societies

## Introduction

In the Futures Annual Symposium 2024, a unique perspective on the future of democracy unfolded. The symposium aimed to explore innovative solutions to the challenges facing democratic institutions, focusing on the potential of citizen assemblies as a means to foster deliberation, counter disinformation, and enhance electoral democracy. This chapter encapsulates the discussions and insights shared, focusing on the role of citizen assemblies in bridging the representation gap and fostering a more inclusive, deliberative democracy.

## The Crisis of Democracy

The symposium opened with a stark diagnosis of the current state of democracy, highlighting the rise of populism, the spread of misinformation, and the growing distrust in democratic institutions. The speaker argued that the answer to these challenges might lie in Democratic Innovation, with citizen assemblies standing out as a potential solution.

## The Role of Citizen Assemblies

Citizen assemblies are democratic processes where citizens are randomly selected to deliberate on specific policy issues or broader democratic reforms. The symposium discussed how these assemblies could be leveraged to address the growing authoritarian tendencies in politics, enhance public trust in democratic institutions, and provide a platform for deliberation and dialogue.

### Citizen Assembly Success Stories

Examples from around the world, including in France, Ireland, and Lithuania, showed that citizen assemblies could lead to significant policy changes, influence lobbying, and contribute to civic preparation in the face of conflict, such as in Ukraine. These success stories demonstrated the potential of citizen assemblies to impact policy-making processes and exert pressure from the grassroots level.

### Challenges and Opportunities

The symposium acknowledged the challenges of implementing citizen assemblies, including the risk of them becoming subject to manipulation by external stakeholders and the possibility of representation fatigue. However, it was argued that with proper institutional support and a commitment to follow-up, the potential for citizen assemblies to impact policy and political culture was immense.

## Democratic Innovation and Electoral Democracy

The discussion then shifted to how citizen assemblies could be integrated into the electoral landscape, with examples from Germany and Belgium showcasing the potential for these assemblies to influence political culture and decision-making processes. The speaker suggested that citizen assemblies could serve as an institutionalized check on the current system, encouraging politicians to cooperate and seek common ground.

### The Power of Citizen Assemblies in Countering Disinformation

A significant portion of the symposium was dedicated to the role of citizen assemblies in countering disinformation, with the speaker noting that deliberation could help build a common understanding and reduce the influence of radical narratives. The potential for citizen assemblies to contribute to strategic communication and counter disinformation was discussed, highlighting the need for such mechanisms in the face of increasing polarization and the erosion of democratic norms.

## Conclusion

The symposium concluded with a call for a paradigm shift in democracy, moving towards a more deliberative and inclusive system. The potential of citizen assemblies to contribute to this shift was emphasized, with the speaker suggesting that these assemblies could serve as a bridge between marginalized groups and the mainstream democratic discourse.

### The Future of Democratic Innovation

In closing, the symposium underscored the importance of institutional innovation and the role of citizen assemblies in enhancing public debate and decision-making processes. The potential for these assemblies to evolve existing institutions was discussed, with the speaker expressing hope that citizen assemblies could inspire governments and political parties to adopt more deliberative practices.

### Final Thoughts

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 provided a platform for an in-depth exploration of citizen assemblies as a tool for Democratic Innovation. The discussions highlighted the potential for these assemblies to contribute to a more inclusive, deliberative democracy. As the world navigates the challenges of the 21st century, the insights from this symposium offer a roadmap for a more resilient and participatory democracy, with citizen assemblies as a key component.

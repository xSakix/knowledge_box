# Chapter 7: The PK Memorial Lecture - Wang Petri on "Contestation and Dynamism in Global Politics"

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 was marked by a special occasion: the second Aart PK Memorial Lecture, held in honor of the late Aart PK, a distinguished senior Austrian diplomat and a key figure in the establishment of the University of Vienna's Center for Advanced Studies. The first lecture, given by former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, set a high bar, and this year's speaker, Wang Petri, was no less distinguished.

Wang Petri, a senior Austrian diplomat with a long and illustrious career, took to the stage to deliver his lecture. His appointment as the director of the Misha Glenny Institute for Global Affairs at the University of Vienna had only recently been announced, adding to his already impressive résumé. As the audience settled in, Wang Petri began his lecture, titled "Contestation and Dynamism in Global Politics."

## A Career in Diplomacy

Wang Petri's career in diplomacy spanned decades and numerous high-level positions. He served as the International High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1997 to 2002, a period marked by the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999. As the Austrian Ambassador to Belgrade during this time, he was a key figure in the international community's attempts to find a peaceful, negotiated solution to the conflict. Wang Petri also served as the EU's Special Representative for Kosovo and the Head of the EU's Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, and was a member of the succession commission tasked with the divorce procedure of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. His last position before his current role was as the Permanent Representative of Austria to the United Nations and the OECD in Geneva. Throughout his career, Wang Petri has been a staunch advocate for multilateralism and diplomatic solutions to international conflicts.

## A Changing World Order

Wang Petri began his lecture by acknowledging the late Aart PK, whom he described as a personal friend and mentor. He then turned his attention to the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape, noting that the world was in a period of "contestation and dynamism" driven by a variety of factors.

He cited the Russian aggression in Ukraine as a key example of this new dynamic, noting that it had altered the nature of European integration and brought an end to the post-Cold War era of relative optimism. The aggressive actions of major powers, the rise of populism and nationalism, and the growing inequality and technological divide between the Global North and South were all contributing to a world that was increasingly characterized by contestation and uncertainty.

## The End of the American Century

Wang Petri argued that the end of the American Century was a significant factor in this changing world order. The unipolar moment that followed the fall of the Soviet Union had given way to a more multipolar world, with China's rise as a major power challenging the United States' dominance. This shift was evident in the increasing questioning of the Western-dominated international order, with countries like China, Russia, and even some Western democracies challenging the rules and institutions established in the post-WWII era.

## The Erosion of Multilateralism

The erosion of multilateralism was another concern for Wang Petri. He noted that the transactional politics of the Trump administration had eroded trust in international institutions, and that the COVID-19 pandemic had exacerbated existing tensions and inequalities. The rise of illiberal democracies and the threat of authoritarianism posed further challenges to the multilateral order.

## The Role of Europe

Given this changing landscape, Wang Petri argued that Europe had a crucial role to play in shaping the new global order. He noted that the European Union had already shown leadership in areas such as artificial intelligence regulation and climate policy, and that it had the potential to become a global political player.

However, he also acknowledged that Europe faced significant challenges, including the need to deepen integration in areas such as foreign and security policy, and the need to address the growing gap between the rich and the poor within and beyond its borders. He argued that Europe needed to adopt a new mental map of the world, recognizing the power of political and economic actors beyond its borders, and developing policy frameworks that were consistent and effective.

## The Future of Europe

Wang Petri concluded his lecture by emphasizing the importance of faith in the future and the need for a spirit of activism and engagement. He noted that the challenges facing Europe and the world were daunting, but not insurmountable. He called for a new generation of political activists, willing to engage with the complex and interconnected issues of our time, and to work towards a more just and sustainable future.

As the audience applauded, Wang Petri took a moment to remember Aart PK, whose spirit of activism and engagement had inspired a generation of diplomats and scholars. The PK Memorial Lecture, he noted, was a fitting tribute to a man who had dedicated his life to the pursuit of a more peaceful and just world.

## Reflection

Wang Petri's lecture was a stark reminder of the challenges facing Europe and the world in the 21st century. The era of American dominance had come to an end, and a new, more contested and dynamic world order was emerging. Europe, with its unique history and cultural traditions, had a crucial role to play in shaping this new order. But it would require bold leadership, a willingness to engage with the complex challenges of our time, and a spirit of activism and engagement that honored the legacy of Aart PK.

As the Futures Annual Symposium 2024 drew to a close, the audience was left with much to reflect upon. The challenges were daunting, but the spirit of activism and engagement that had characterized the symposium was a cause for optimism. The future, as Wang Petri had reminded them, was in their hands.

In the words of Wang Petri, "The world is changing, and we must change with it. We must have faith in the future, and we must be activists in the pursuit of a more just and sustainable world. That is the spirit of Aart PK, and that is the spirit that must guide us as we navigate the challenges of our time."

# Chapter 8: Rethinking European Democracy at the Futures Annual Symposium 2024

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 brought together a diverse range of experts, academics, and policymakers to discuss the future of Europe and its democratic processes. This chapter will delve into the key discussions and ideas exchanged during the symposium, focusing on the presentations and Q&A sessions that explored the themes of democratic legitimacy, participation, and European integration.

## Alberto Alano: Revisiting the People's Project and the Democratic Deficit in Europe

The symposium began with a presentation by Alberto Alano, a renowned academic and expert on European integration. Alano took the audience on a historical journey back to the late 1990s, when the 'People's Project' was first envisioned as a way to describe the then-newly elected British Labour government's Third Way politics. Alano reminded the audience that the idea of a 'Peoples Republic of Europe' was not a new concept, but rather a revival of an old one that had been dormant for nearly three decades.

Alano argued that the democratic deficit in Europe was not merely a matter of representation but also a problem of participation and legitimacy. He posited that the European Union (EU) had deliberately sacrificed democracy in favor of integration, and that this had led to a permissive consensus among European citizens. Alano called for a rethinking of the European project, one that placed democracy at its core and engaged European citizens in meaningful ways.

* **Key Points:**
	+ The 'People's Project' was a historical attempt to describe a new kind of politics that emphasized people-centric governance.
	+ The democratic deficit in Europe is not just about representation but also about participation and legitimacy.
	+ The EU has sacrificed democracy in favor of integration, leading to a permissive consensus among European citizens.
	+ Alano called for a rethinking of the European project that prioritizes democracy and engages European citizens.

## Rosa Balfour: Democratic Legitimacy and the European Union

Rosa Balfour, the Director of the Europe Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, took the stage to discuss the issue of democratic legitimacy in the European Union. Balfour argued that the EU's democratic deficit was not a result of a lack of representative democracy but rather a lack of participatory democracy.

Balfour pointed out that the EU had a complex system of multi-level governance, with decision-making power dispersed among national governments, the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European Council. She argued that this complexity made it difficult for European citizens to understand and engage with the EU's decision-making processes, leading to a lack of democratic legitimacy.

Balfour called for a more inclusive and participatory democracy in Europe, one that engaged European citizens at all levels of governance. She suggested that this could be achieved through a variety of means, including a European-wide public consultation process, the creation of a European constituency, and the establishment of a European Citizens' Assembly.

* **Key Points:**
	+ The EU's democratic deficit is not about a lack of representative democracy but rather a lack of participatory democracy.
	+ The EU's complex system of multi-level governance makes it difficult for European citizens to engage with decision-making processes.
	+ Balfour called for a more inclusive and participatory democracy in Europe, with European citizens engaged at all levels of governance.
	+ She suggested several means to achieve this, including a European-wide public consultation process, a European constituency, and a European Citizens' Assembly.

## Nikolaos Milonas: Rethinking Accession and Membership in Europe

Nikolaos Milonas, a Professor of International Political Economy at the University of Glasgow, presented a provocative idea: rethinking accession and membership in Europe. Milonas argued that the EU's enlargement process had been a failure, with new member states often struggling to meet the EU's standards and citizens often disillusioned with the EU.

Milonas proposed a new approach to accession and membership, one that prioritized democratic legitimacy and citizen engagement. He suggested that potential member states should be required to hold a referendum on EU membership as part of the accession process, and that existing member states should be required to hold regular referendums on their continued EU membership.

Milonas also called for a more flexible and differentiated system of EU membership, one that allowed for different levels of integration and different speeds of convergence. He argued that this would allow for a more inclusive and democratic EU, one that could accommodate the diverse needs and preferences of its citizens.

* **Key Points:**
	+ Milonas argued that the EU's enlargement process had been a failure, with new member states struggling to meet EU standards and citizens disillusioned with the EU.
	+ He proposed a new approach to accession and membership, prioritizing democratic legitimacy and citizen engagement.
	+ Milonas suggested that potential member states should be required to hold a referendum on EU membership, and that existing member states should hold regular referendums on their continued EU membership.
	+ He also called for a more flexible and differentiated system of EU membership, allowing for different levels of integration and speeds of convergence.

## Iana Mates: The Case for a European Constituency

Iana Mates, a Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge, made the case for a European constituency, an electoral system that would allow European citizens to vote for Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) who represent European-wide constituencies rather than national ones.

Mates argued that a European constituency would address the democratic deficit in Europe by increasing the accountability of MEPs to European citizens. She also pointed out that a European constituency would encourage a more pan-European politics, one that could transcend national boundaries and foster a more European-wide public sphere.

Mates acknowledged that the creation of a European constituency would face significant challenges, including the need to harmonize electoral laws across the EU and the potential for European-wide political parties to dominate the European Parliament. However, she argued that these challenges were not insurmountable and that the benefits of a European constituency outweighed the costs.

* **Key Points:**
	+ Mates made the case for a European constituency, an electoral system that would allow European citizens to vote for MEPs who represent European-wide constituencies.
	+ She argued that a European constituency would address the democratic deficit in Europe by increasing the accountability of MEPs to European citizens.
	+ Mates also pointed out that a European constituency would encourage a more pan-European politics and foster a more European-wide public sphere.
	+ She acknowledged that the creation of a European constituency would face significant challenges but argued that the benefits outweighed the costs.

## The Transnational List Experiment: A Pathway to Pan-European Politics?

One of the most innovative and controversial ideas discussed at the symposium was the transnational list experiment, a proposal to create a European-wide political party that would run candidates across national borders in the European Parliament elections.

The proposal was met with both enthusiasm and skepticism. Supporters argued that the transnational list experiment would encourage a more pan-European politics, one that could transcend national boundaries and foster a more European-wide public sphere. They also pointed out that the experiment had already been successfully conducted in Austria, where a transnational list had won a significant number of seats in the European Parliament elections.

However, critics argued that the transnational list experiment would be difficult to implement, requiring significant changes to the EU's electoral laws and the potential for European-wide political parties to dominate the European Parliament. They also pointed out that the experiment could lead to a 'democracy of distant strangers,' where European citizens would be represented by MEPs who they had no connection to and who they could not hold accountable.

* **Key Points:**
	+ The transnational list experiment was a proposal to create a European-wide political party that would run candidates across national borders in the European Parliament elections.
	+ Supporters argued that the experiment would encourage a more pan-European politics and foster a more European-wide public sphere.
	+ Critics argued that the experiment would be difficult to implement and could lead to a 'democracy of distant strangers.'

## Rethinking European Democracy: Next Steps

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 brought together a range of experts and academics to discuss the future of Europe and its democratic processes. The presentations and discussions at the symposium made it clear that the EU faces significant challenges in the realm of democratic legitimacy and participation, with many calling for a rethinking of the European project.

The symposium also made it clear that there are no easy answers to these challenges, with different experts and academics proposing a range of solutions, from a European constituency to a transnational list experiment. However, what was clear from the discussions was that the EU must prioritize democratic legitimacy and citizen engagement if it is to maintain the support and trust of its citizens.

# The Russian-Ukrainian War and the Rise of Far-Right Politics in Europe

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 kicked off with a panel discussion titled "Russia's Aggression towards Ukraine: The Rise of Far-Right Politics in Europe." Moderated by Hannah Shelest, a specialist in radicalization research, the panel featured two speakers: Peter Balash, a security analyst, and Ivan, a conflict and security specialist with a focus on the political spectrum.

## The Russian Aggression and European Unity

Hannah began by discussing the Russian aggression towards Ukraine, highlighting how the war has had both intended and unintended consequences on Europe. While the intended consequence was the division of Europe, the unintended consequence was a surge in European transatlantic unity in response to Russia's aggression. However, Hannah also noted that the war has had significant consequences for the rise of far-right and extreme politician parties in Europe, specifically in countries like Germany and the Netherlands.

## The Far-Right Reaction to the Russian Aggression

Peter Balash, in his comments, echoed Hannah's sentiments about the Russian aggression and its impact on Europe. He also discussed the reactions of far-right parties to the Russian aggression towards Ukraine. Balash noted that while many far-right parties supported Ukraine due to its strong armed force and its fight for nationhood and sovereignty, there were also exceptions. He cited the example of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which initially supported Ukraine but later changed its stance, citing the need to protect Germany's economic interests.

Balash also discussed the anti-establishment sentiment among far-right parties, which often manifests as anti-imperialism. He argued that these parties see Russia as a bulwark against Western imperialism and Brussels institutions. He also noted that many far-right parties are anti-American, seeing the United States as a threat to their national interests.

However, Balash also raised the question of whether far-right parties' anti-European Union (EU) stance is driven by ideology or opportunism. He argued that many far-right parties are opportunistic, supporting Russia or the EU depending on what best serves their domestic political interests.

## The Role of Russia in the Rise of Far-Right Politics

Ivan, in his presentation, discussed the role of Russia in the rise of far-right politics in Europe. He argued that Russia has been actively supporting far-right and anti-establishment parties in Europe, viewing them as useful allies in its geopolitical struggles. Ivan cited examples of Russian support for far-right parties in Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands.

However, Ivan also noted that Russia's support for far-right parties has had unintended consequences. He argued that the exposure of Russia's interference in European politics has led to a backlash against Russian influence, even among far-right parties. He cited the example of Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Rally party in France, who rejected Russian money after the exposure of Russia's attempts to influence French politics.

## The Ukrainian Perspective on European Far-Right Parties

Ivan also discussed the Ukrainian perspective on European far-right parties. He argued that while many far-right parties in Europe are Pro-Russian, there are also many that are pro-Ukraine. He cited the examples of the Polish Law and Justice party and the Slovenian Democratic Party, both of which are strongly pro-Ukraine.

However, Ivan also noted that many far-right parties in Europe are opportunistic, changing their stance on Ukraine depending on what best serves their domestic political interests. He also discussed the role of Russian influence in shaping the positions of far-right parties on Ukraine, noting that many far-right parties have received Russian money and support.

## The Impact of the Russian Aggression on European Politics

The panelists also discussed the impact of the Russian aggression on European politics. Hannah argued that the war has had a polarizing effect on European societies, with many people feeling that they are losing something even as they support Ukraine. She also noted that the war has had a significant impact on migration and refugee policies in Europe, with many countries becoming more restrictive.

Balash argued that the war has also had a significant impact on the debate around European security and defense policy. He noted that many European countries are now rethinking their defense spending and their reliance on the United States for security.

Ivan argued that the war has also had a significant impact on European unity, noting that the war has brought Europe closer together even as it has also exposed deep divisions. He also discussed the impact of the war on European public opinion, noting that many Europeans are now more supportive of Ukraine than they were before the war.

## The Future of European Politics

The panelists also discussed the future of European politics in the context of the Russian aggression towards Ukraine. Hannah argued that the war has brought about a significant change in the European political landscape, noting that the war has exposed the limits of the EU's influence and the need for a more robust European security and defense policy.

Balash argued that the war has also brought about a significant change in the international political landscape, noting that the war has exposed the limits of Western influence and the need for a more nuanced approach to Russia. He also discussed the impact of the war on the debate around the future of the EU, noting that the war has brought about a significant debate around the EU's role in the world.

Ivan argued that the war has also brought about a significant change in the Ukrainian political landscape, noting that the war has exposed the need for a more inclusive and democratic political system. He also discussed the impact of the war on the debate around Ukraine's future, noting that the war has brought about a significant debate around Ukraine's identity and its place in Europe.

## Conclusion

The panel discussion on "Russia's Aggression towards Ukraine: The Rise of Far-Right Politics in Europe" highlighted the complex and multifaceted impact of the Russian aggression towards Ukraine on European politics. The panelists discussed the reactions of far-right parties to the Russian aggression, the role of Russia in the rise of far-right politics, the Ukrainian perspective on European far-right parties, and the impact of the Russian aggression on European politics. They also discussed the future of European politics in the context of the Russian aggression towards Ukraine. The panelists agreed that the war has had significant consequences for European politics, both intended and unintended, and that the future of European politics will be shaped by how Europe responds to the challenges posed by the war.

# Chapter 7: The AI Democracy Dilemma: Navigating the Future of Higher Education and AI

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 gathered thought leaders from various fields to discuss the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and democracy. This chapter presents a transcript of the morning session, which delved into the implications of AI on academic freedom, intellectual discourse, and the role of universities in fostering informed citizenship. The conversation was enriched by insights from experts in political sociology, AI ethics, and higher education governance.

## The AI Challenge to Democratic Education

Dr. **Gregor Mikov**, a professor of political sociology, opened the discussion by presenting his latest publication, an empirical study on the impact of AI on democracies in the Visegrád countries. He emphasized the value of empirical research in understanding the challenges posed by AI to democracies. The cover image of his publication, generated by AI, sparked intrigue among the attendees, leading to a brief interlude on the discernibility of AI-generated content.

Dr. **Katy Hayward**, professor of political sociology and codirector of the Center for International Border Research at Queen's University Belfast, delivered the keynote address. She began by expressing gratitude for the Europe's Futures Fellowship, which enabled her to engage with the profound challenges posed by AI in academia. Hayward raised concerns about the struggle to distinguish AI-generated essays from those written by students, highlighting the potential for AI to undermine academic integrity. Moreover, she pondered the implications of AI for the future of intellectual discourse and the role of universities in nurturing informed citizenship.

## AI and the Erosion of Intellectual Discernment

Hayward introduced the concept of 'fruitful thoughtlessness'—the idea that AI, while offering convenience and time-saving, could erode intellectual discernment. She argued that universities, in their pursuit of neoliberal efficiency, may be culpable in this regard. Drawing on the work of John Dewey, she emphasized the importance of universities in fostering critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness—three pillars of liberal arts that are essential for a functioning liberal democracy.

Hayward presented a case study of a prestigious photography award in which the winning entry was generated by AI. She explored the implications of this development for authorship, copyright, and intellectual property in the age of AI. She also discussed a recent dispute at Cambridge Analytica, in which AI was used to facilitate global surveillance and influence political outcomes, endangering democratic participatory elements.

## The AI Productivity Revolution: Promise and Peril

**Luke Cooper**, a researcher at the Conflict Civicness Research Group and a fellow of the Europe's Futures programme, took the stage next. He discussed the potential of AI to unlock productivity growth and address the productivity crisis in the West. Cooper acknowledged the hope that AI could transform sectors such as pharmaceuticals and cancer treatments. However, he cautioned that AI could also exacerbate exploitation and inequality, as seen in the gig economy and predictive policing.

Cooper also raised concerns about the commercialization of knowledge and the commodification of education. He argued that universities, in their pursuit of market-driven efficiency, may be losing sight of their role in fostering informed citizenship and critical thinking. He suggested that universities could become more future-oriented, fostering creativity, collaboration, and discernment—attributes that AI, in its current form, lacks.

## AI and the Future of Liberal Arts Education

**Sonia Boanich**, the host of the gathering and the executive director of the Center for Advanced Study in Southeast Europe, took the stage to introduce the final speaker. She reflected on the importance of liberal arts education in fostering critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness—the very qualities needed to navigate the complex challenges posed by AI.

**Alberto Toscano**, a professor of sociology at the University of Warwick, delivered the final presentation. He echoed Hayward's concerns about the erosion of intellectual discernment in the age of AI. Drawing on the work of Peter Geyer and other scholars, Toscano argued that AI could exacerbate the problem of 'thoughtlessness' in academia, leading to a proliferation of bullshitting and empty statements.

Toscano also raised concerns about the commercialization of knowledge and the market-driven metrics used to assess academic productivity. He argued that universities, in their pursuit of market-driven efficiency, may be losing sight of their role in fostering critical thinking and informed citizenship. Toscano suggested that universities could become more future-oriented, fostering creativity, collaboration, and discernment—the very qualities that AI, in its current form, lacks.

## The Way Forward: Fostering AI Literacy and Critical Thinking

The panelists and attendees engaged in a lively discussion following the presentations. Several key themes emerged:

1. **AI Literacy**: The panelists agreed that universities must prioritize AI literacy, equipping students with the critical thinking skills needed to navigate the complex challenges posed by AI. This includes the ability to discern AI-generated content from human-written content, as well as an understanding of the ethical, social, and political implications of AI.

2. **Fostering Critical Thinking**: The panelists emphasized the importance of critical thinking in the age of AI. They argued that universities must foster intellectual discernment, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness—the very qualities that AI, in its current form, lacks. This includes encouraging students to engage with AI critically, rather than simply using it as a tool.

3. **The Role of Universities**: The panelists agreed that universities have a unique role to play in fostering informed citizenship and critical thinking in the age of AI. They argued that universities must resist the market-driven metrics used to assess academic productivity and instead prioritize intellectual discernment, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness.

4. **The Future of Liberal Arts Education**: The panelists suggested that universities could become more future-oriented, fostering creativity, collaboration, and discernment—the very qualities that AI, in its current form, lacks. This includes encouraging students to think critically about the ethical, social, and political implications of AI and to engage with AI in a way that enriches, rather than replaces, human intelligence.

## Conclusion: Navigating the AI Democracy Dilemma

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 highlighted the profound challenges posed by AI to academic freedom, intellectual discourse, and the role of universities in fostering informed citizenship. The panelists and attendees emphasized the importance of AI literacy, critical thinking, and the unique role of universities in navigating the complex challenges posed by AI.

As AI continues to transform societies and institutions, universities must prioritize the fostering of critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness. This includes encouraging students to engage with AI critically, rather than simply using it as a tool, and fostering intellectual discernment, ethical reasoning, and civic awareness in the face of market-driven metrics.

In conclusion, the AI democracy dilemma is a complex and multifaceted challenge that demands the attention and efforts of academics, policymakers, and citizens alike. By engaging with these challenges critically and collaboratively, we can ensure that AI serves as a force for positive transformation, rather than a threat to democratic values and institutions.


## Europe's Futures Annual Symposium 2024: Vladimir Arsenijević

# The Crocodile's Gaze: Cultural Activism and State Violence in Belgrade

The Futures Annual Symposium in 2024 was a vibrant gathering of minds, a crucible of ideas where the future seemed to be forged in the heat of passionate debates. Among the many captivating presentations, one stood out for its raw honesty and profound insight: Vladimir Arsić's discussion on the rise of cultural violence in Belgrade, titled "The Crocodile's Gaze: Cultural Activism and State Violence in Belgrade." Arsić, a prolific writer and cultural worker, brought a unique perspective to the symposium, having left Serbia six years ago due to the toxic political environment, only to return to confront it head-on through his literary festival, Crocodile Belgrade.

## The Toxic Mural: Neosa Street and the State's Complicity

Arsić began by painting a vivid picture of Neosa Street, a quiet, walkable street in central Belgrade, lined with linden trees and marked by a peculiar mural. The mural, depicting a war criminal, Ratko Mladić, had been glorified by far-right groups, reflecting a disturbing obsession with Serbian nationalism and militarism. Arsić argued that this mural was not just a piece of graffiti; it was a symptom of a deeper societal issue, a symptom that the Serbian state had failed to address, thereby fostering an environment where such toxic ideologies could flourish.

The mural, Arsić asserted, was part of a larger trend of far-right activity in Belgrade. Murals glorifying war criminals, suprematist symbols, and anti-liberal slogans had become commonplace, with the state turning a blind eye to the growing menace. The graffiti was not just a form of expression; it was a statement of intent, a warning of the state's complicity in the rising tide of cultural violence.

## The School Shooting and the State's Response

Arsić's presentation took a dark turn when he spoke about the school shooting in May 2023. A 13-year-old boy had entered a school in Belgrade, armed with semi-automatic weapons, and opened fire, murdering seven students and a school guard. The boy, Costa Komanović, was later found to be mentally ill, but his actions were a grim testament to the state of Serbian society.

The shooting had shocked the nation, but Arsić argued that the state's response was inadequate. The government had passed a law making it illegal to write or paint graffiti on buildings, but Arsić saw this as a superficial response, a band-aid on a gaping wound. The state was not addressing the root cause of the violence, he asserted. Instead, it was using the law to silence dissent and maintain its grip on power.

## The State's Role in the Far-Right Resurgence

Arsić was scathing in his critique of the Serbian state's role in the far-right resurgence. He pointed out that the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) had actively courted the far-right, using their rhetoric and even incorporating them into the party structure. The state, Arsić argued, was not a neutral actor in this drama. It was a willing participant, using the far-right to maintain its hold on power.

The state's complicity was not just limited to the far-right. Arsić spoke about the infiltration of far-right groups into the security apparatus, including the police and private security companies. This, he argued, was a deliberate strategy to protect the state's interests and to suppress any dissent.

## The Crocodile's Gaze: A Call to Action

Arsić concluded his presentation with a call to action. He spoke about the need to confront the state's complicity in the rising tide of cultural violence. He called for a reckoning, for a moment of truth where the state would acknowledge its role in fostering this toxic environment.

He also spoke about the need for a different kind of activism, one that would not just content itself with protesting against the state, but would also work to build alternative spaces, spaces where different narratives could be told, where a different future could be imagined.

## The Debate: Reflections and Refutations

Arsić's presentation sparked a lively debate. Some panelists, like Ivana Dragović and Zoran Šimić, echoed Arsić's concerns, speaking about the need for a more nuanced understanding of the far-right and the state's role in its resurgence. Others, like Kristof Horváth, offered more skeptical views, pointing out the need for more empirical evidence and a more cautious approach to activism.

The debate highlighted the complexity of the issue. It was clear that there were no easy solutions, no simple answers. But it was also clear that the issue was too important to be ignored. The state's complicity in the rising tide of cultural violence was a stark reminder of the fragility of democracy, of the ease with which it could be eroded from within.

Arsić's presentation, and the debate it sparked, was a stark reminder of the challenges that lie ahead. The road to a more democratic, more just, more equal Serbia is long and fraught with danger. But it is not a road that can be ignored. It is a road that must be walked, one step at a time, with courage, with honesty, and with a fierce commitment to the truth.

In the end, Arsić's presentation was not just a critique of the Serbian state. It was a call to action, a call to confront the truth, to acknowledge the state's complicity in the rising tide of cultural violence, and to work towards a more just, more equal, more democratic society. It was a call that echoed through the symposium, a call that could not, and should not, be ignored.

# The Russia Panel at Futures Annual Symposium 2024

The Russia panel at the Futures Annual Symposium 2024 was a thought-provoking discussion that delved into the complex history and future prospects of Russia. Moderated by Tom Deval, the panel featured Kadri Liiva, Gregory Mikovits, and Rosa DiCaprio, who shared their insights and perspectives on the trajectory of Russia and its place in the global order.

## Tom Deval's Introduction

Tom Deval began the panel by acknowledging the unpredictable nature of Russia's history, noting that it has never followed a straight line. He recalled the unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of Vladimir Putin, who had initially promised stability but ultimately consolidated power and undermined democratic institutions. Deval expressed skepticism about the idea that Russia could simply return to a linear path of democratization, as it had done in many other post-communist countries.

Deval introduced Kadri Liiva, a Russian historian and Fellow of the European Council on Foreign Relations, who would be leading the discussion. Liiva had spent much of his career studying Russia and had witnessed the country's transformation firsthand. Deval noted that Liiva's personal history and intellectual journey would inform his perspective on Russia's past and future.

## Kadri Liiva's Presentation

Liiva began by recounting his personal journey with Russia, starting from his first visit to Moscow in 1987 as a young Estonian. He described his initial fascination with the country and his subsequent disillusionment as he realized that Russia often did not behave as he expected. Liiva emphasized the importance of understanding the internal compass of Russian society, which had been shaped by its experience under communism and its relationship with the West.

Liiva argued that the period of perestroika had been a unique moment in Russian history, characterized by fluidity and creativity. He criticized the Western tendency to view the struggle between communism and democracy as a linear narrative, noting that the reality had been much more chaotic and dynamic. Liiva expressed his concern that the West had missed the opportunity to support democratic forces in Russia during the 1990s, a mistake that had contributed to the rise of Putin.

Liiva also discussed the concept of the "negative identity" that had emerged under Putin, in which Russians saw themselves primarily in opposition to the West. He noted that this identity had been a powerful political tool for Putin but had also limited Russia's potential for positive development. Liiva suggested that Russia's future would depend on its ability to move beyond this negative identity and find a new, positive narrative to unite its people.

## The Discussion

### The Soviet Economy and the Failure of Reform

The panelists then turned to the topic of the Soviet economy and the failure of reform in the 1990s. Liiva noted that the Soviet economy had been in crisis long before the collapse of the Union, and that Gorbachev's attempt to reform it had been inadequate. He argued that the Chinese model of economic reform, which had allowed for the preservation of political power while introducing market reforms, could have been a useful guide for Russia. However, he acknowledged that Russia's political system had been less adaptable than China's, and that the country had ultimately failed to make the necessary changes.

Mikovits agreed that the Soviet economy had been in trouble long before the collapse, but argued that the real problem had been the political system itself. He noted that the Soviet Union had been an imperialist power, and that its collapse had been inevitable given the rise of nationalism in the republics. Mikovits suggested that Russia's future would depend on its ability to reckon with its imperialist past and build a more democratic and federalist system.

DiCaprio offered a more optimistic perspective, noting that Russia had made significant progress in the economic sphere since the collapse of the Soviet Union. She argued that Russia's economic reforms had been more successful than is often acknowledged, and that the country had a strong base of skilled professionals who could help drive future growth. However, she acknowledged that Russia's political system remained a significant obstacle to further progress.

### The Putin Regime and the Prospects for Change

The panelists also discussed the prospects for change in Russia under the Putin regime. Liiva expressed pessimism about the possibility of a return to a more democratic system, noting that Russia had become a consolidated authoritarian state under Putin. He argued that the West had made a strategic mistake in supporting Putin's rise to power, and that it had failed to hold him accountable for his actions.

Mikovits agreed that the prospects for democratization in Russia were bleak, but argued that the West could still play a role in promoting change. He suggested that the West should focus on supporting civil society and promoting a more democratic political culture in Russia, rather than trying to impose democratic reforms from the outside.

DiCaprio offered a more hopeful perspective, noting that Russia had experienced a period of democratization in the 1990s, and that it could do so again. She argued that the West should focus on promoting economic reforms and supporting civil society in Russia, rather than engaging in a fruitless struggle for democratization.

### The Role of History and National Identity in Russia's Future

Finally, the panelists discussed the role of history and national identity in Russia's future. Liiva argued that Russia's future would depend on its ability to come to terms with its imperialist past and build a more democratic and inclusive political system. He noted that Russia's negative identity had been a powerful political tool for Putin, but had also limited the country's potential for positive development.

Mikovits agreed that Russia's future would depend on its ability to reckon with its imperialist past, but argued that Russia's national identity was also a significant obstacle to change. He suggested that Russia's national identity was rooted in a sense of victimhood and a desire for recognition from the West, and that this identity had made it difficult for the country to engage in a more constructive dialogue with the international community.

DiCaprio offered a more optimistic perspective, noting that Russia had a rich history of democratic thought and that there was a strong tradition of civil society in the country. She argued that Russia's future would depend on its ability to build on this tradition and promote a more inclusive and democratic political culture.

## Conclusion

The Russia panel at the Futures Annual Symposium 2024 was a wide-ranging and insightful discussion that covered a broad range of topics, from the collapse of the Soviet Union to the prospects for democratization under the Putin regime. The panelists offered a range of perspectives on Russia's past and future, and their discussion highlighted the complexity and unpredictability of Russia's history. Despite their differences, the panelists agreed that Russia's future would depend on its ability to reckon with its past and build a more democratic and inclusive political system. The West, they suggested, had a role to play in supporting this process, but it would need to be more strategic and nuanced in its approach than it had been in the past.

# The Rise of Populism and the Far Right in Slovakia: A Case Study

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 brought together experts and policymakers to discuss the shifting political landscape in Europe, with a particular focus on the rise of populism and the far right. This chapter will delve into the Slovak case study, drawing from the symposium's insights to explore the complex dynamics at play in the country's recent political trajectory.

## Background: The Assassination Attempt on Robert Fico and the Political Context

The symposium began with a discussion on the assassination attempt on Robert Fico, the former Prime Minister of Slovakia, and its implications for the country's political landscape. The attempted assassination, which occurred in February 2024, was seen as a dramatic event that exposed the deep polarization and tension within Slovak society.

Fico, a populist and far-right leader, had been under investigation for corruption and abuse of power. The attempted assassination was seen by some as a result of the political atmosphere created by the ruling coalition's aggressive tactics and the opposition's allegations of corruption. However, the symposium's panelists agreed that the assassination attempt was an unprecedented and unacceptable act of violence.

## The Political Configuration of Slovakia: A Divided Society

The symposium highlighted the polarized political configuration of Slovakia, with two main camps competing for power. On one side, there was the national populist camp, represented by Fico's Smer-SD party and the Slovak National Party (SNS), which catered to the Hungarian minority. On the other side, there was the liberal democratic camp, comprising the Progressive Slovakia (PS) party and the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), among others.

The two camps were separated by ideological divides, with the national populist camp advocating for a stronger Slovakia, with a focus on nationalism, sovereignty, and traditional family values. In contrast, the liberal democratic camp promoted a more open, pro-European, and progressive agenda.

## The Rise of Populism and the Far Right in Slovakia

The rise of populism and the far right in Slovakia was seen as a symptom of deeper societal issues. The symposium's panelists agreed that the assassination attempt on Fico was a manifestation of the extreme polarization within Slovak society, fueled by the populist rhetoric of both sides.

The panelists noted that the far right in Slovakia had become increasingly mainstream, with the SNS, a nationalist party with extremist elements, being part of the ruling coalition. The party's leader, Andrej Danko, had become the speaker of parliament, giving the far right significant influence over the political agenda.

The symposium also touched on the role of the media in exacerbating the political polarization. The ruling coalition was accused of using its control over the media to blame the opposition for the assassination attempt, further inflaming tensions.

## The Far Right and the Media: A Dangerous Alliance

The symposium panelists discussed the dangerous alliance between the far right and the media in Slovakia. The ruling coalition had been accused of using its control over the media to spread disinformation and propaganda, further polarizing the political landscape.

The panelists noted that the far right had become adept at using social media to spread its message, bypassing traditional media outlets. The rise of conspiracy theories and fake news had contributed to the polarization of society, with people increasingly turning to alternative sources of information.

## The European Context: The Far Right's Growing Influence

The symposium panelists also discussed the European context for the rise of populism and the far right. They noted that the far right was gaining influence across the continent, with parties like Marine Le Pen's National Rally in France, Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, and Alternative for Germany (AfD) making significant gains in elections.

The panelists agreed that the far right's rise was part of a broader trend towards nationalism and xenophobia, fueled by concerns over immigration, terrorism, and the perceived loss of cultural identity.

## The Future of Populism and the Far Right in Slovakia

The symposium panelists were divided on the future trajectory of populism and the far right in Slovakia. Some argued that the assassination attempt on Fico would lead to a backlash against the far right, with voters punishing the SNS in the upcoming elections. Others were less optimistic, noting that the far right had shown an ability to adapt and evolve, and that its support base was likely to remain stable.

Regardless of the outcome, the symposium panelists agreed that the rise of populism and the far right in Slovakia was a wake-up call for democratic institutions. They urged the international community to support civil society organizations, independent media, and other democratic forces in the country, and to stand up for the values of democracy and human rights.

## Conclusion

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 provided a comprehensive overview of the political landscape in Slovakia, with a particular focus on the rise of populism and the far right. The symposium's panelists highlighted the complex dynamics at play in the country, from the assassination attempt on Fico to the polarization of society and the influence of the media.

The symposium also emphasized the European context for the rise of populism and the far right, and the need for democratic institutions to adapt to the challenges posed by these forces. As Slovakia and other European countries grapple with the consequences of populism and the far right, the insights from the symposium will be crucial in shaping the response to these challenges.

# Chapter 7: Harnessing the Power of Citizen Assemblies: A Pan-European Perspective

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 gathered thought leaders and practitioners to explore the potential of citizen assemblies in addressing democratic erosion and authoritarian tendencies, with a particular focus on Central and Eastern Europe. This chapter will delve into the key insights and debates that emerged during the second session of the symposium, titled "Inclusive and Participatory Democracy: Can Citizen Assemblies Bridge the Division Within Democratic Societies?"

## The Promise of Citizen Assemblies

The session opened with a presentation by **Anna**, a fellow at Democracy Next, an NGO that helps design and advise on citizen assemblies. Anna argued that citizen assemblies could help address authoritarian tendencies in the region by building resilient democratic systems and empowering citizens to participate meaningfully in decision-making processes.

Citizen assemblies, also known as mini-publics or deliberative polls, are randomly selected groups of citizens brought together to deliberate on specific policy issues. They offer two key benefits: **deliberation** and **participation**. Deliberation, as opposed to debate or dialogue, aims to seek common ground and develop recommendations that reflect the considered views of the group, rather than the most persuasive arguments. Participation, through random selection, ensures that the group is representative of the wider population, including those who are often marginalized or underrepresented in traditional democratic processes.

Anna highlighted several examples of citizen assemblies that have yielded positive outcomes, from abortion referendums in Ireland and France to climate change policy in Poland. She also noted that the deliberative wave, which began in the Western world, has been gaining traction in Central and Eastern Europe, with over 700 examples recorded by the OECD since 2016.

## Addressing Democratic Erosion

Anna identified three main challenges facing democracies in Central and Eastern Europe: internal power capture, foreign interference, and democratic erosion. She argued that citizen assemblies could help address these challenges by preventing political parties and populist leaders from weaponizing divisive issues, reducing misinformation and disinformation, and fostering a sense of collective agency and civic responsibility.

Anna presented several examples of how citizen assemblies have been used strategically to address divisive issues, such as the Irish abortion referendum and a referendum on abortion in Poland led by the Citizens' Assembly on Abortion. She also noted that climate change, a global issue with local implications, has been a common topic for citizen assemblies in the region.

## Challenges and Skepticism

While Anna presented a compelling case for citizen assemblies, the session also heard from skeptics who raised important challenges and concerns.

**Heather** questioned whether citizen assemblies were sufficient in addressing the democratic threat facing societies today. She argued that representation in democracies today is not fully sufficient, and that citizen assemblies, while helpful, are not a panacea. She also raised concerns about the potential for populist hijacking of citizen assemblies and the need for robust oversight and safeguards.

**Alberto** echoed Heather's concerns about populist hijacking and also raised questions about the overestimating of the value of citizen expertise in decision-making. He cautioned that while citizen assemblies can provide useful input, they should not replace the expertise of elected representatives and professionals.

**Kristoff** expressed skepticism about the ability of citizen assemblies to address divisive issues, arguing that they risked becoming a victim of their own success. He also raised concerns about the potential for interest groups to lobby and manipulate citizen assemblies.

## Navigating Dystopian Scenarios

The session then turned to a discussion of how to navigate dystopian scenarios, where authoritarian tendencies are strong, and populist hijacking is a real risk.

**Ed** argued that the key to avoiding hijacking was ensuring that citizen assemblies were impartial, with independent organizers and protection for participants. He also highlighted the importance of impartiality in the selection of experts and evidence provided to participants.

**Heather** emphasized the need for a pan-European guideline on citizen assemblies, arguing that the EU could play a useful role in promoting best practices and mitigating risks. She also raised the question of whether deliberation on divisive issues could be helpful, or whether it was better to leave such issues to elected representatives.

**Anna** responded to these concerns by emphasizing the importance of capacity building and international collaboration. She argued that citizen assemblies are a complex tool, and that practitioners need to learn from one another and share best practices.

## European Perspectives

The session concluded with a discussion of European perspectives on citizen assemblies. **Kristoff** argued that the key issue for deliberation in Central and Eastern Europe was civic preparation and resilience, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine. He also raised the question of whether deliberation on divisive issues could be helpful, or whether it was better to leave such issues to elected representatives.

**Alberto** echoed Heather's call for a pan-European guideline, arguing that the EU could play a useful role in promoting best practices and mitigating risks. He also raised concerns about the potential for interest groups to lobby and manipulate citizen assemblies.

**Anna** concluded the session by emphasizing the importance of international collaboration and capacity building. She argued that citizen assemblies are a complex tool, and that practitioners need to learn from one another and share best practices.

## Conclusion

The Futures Annual Symposium 2024 highlighted the promise of citizen assemblies in addressing democratic erosion and authoritarian tendencies in Central and Eastern Europe. While citizen assemblies offer a powerful tool for deliberation and participation, they are not without their challenges and risks. The session heard from skeptics who raised important concerns about populist hijacking, the overestimating of citizen expertise, and the potential for manipulation. The panelists agreed that navigating dystopian scenarios requires robust oversight, impartiality, and international collaboration. As the deliberative wave gains traction in Central and Eastern Europe, it is crucial that practitioners learn from one another and share best practices to ensure that citizen assemblies remain a force for democratic innovation and renewal.

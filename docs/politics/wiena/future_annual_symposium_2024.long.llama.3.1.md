**The Legacy of Aart de Geus**

The lecture began with an introduction by the moderator, who spoke about Aart de Geus's legacy and his impact on the field of European studies. The moderator noted that de Geus was a mentor, friend, and someone who had played a crucial role in putting together the University of Vienna's Center for Advanced Study. The moderator also mentioned that de Geus was a rare breed, combining the qualities of a public intellectual, a politician, and a practitioner of politics.

**The Current State of Europe**

Wang Petri began his lecture by expressing his gratitude to the organizers of the event and his respect for Aart de Geus's memory. He then turned to the topic at hand, discussing the current state of Europe and its place in the world. Petri noted that Europe is facing a number of challenges, including the rise of nationalism, the impact of climate change, and the need for greater cooperation and coordination among EU member states.

**The Rise of Nationalism**

Petri spoke about the rise of nationalism in Europe, citing the example of the Brexit referendum in the UK and the growing popularity of populist parties across the continent. He noted that this trend is not limited to Europe, but is also a global phenomenon, with many countries experiencing a resurgence of nationalist sentiment.

**The Impact of Climate Change**

Petri also discussed the impact of climate change on Europe, highlighting the need for greater cooperation and coordination among EU member states to address this issue. He noted that climate change is a global problem that requires a global response, and that Europe must play a leading role in this effort.

**The Need for Greater Cooperation**

Petri emphasized the need for greater cooperation and coordination among EU member states, citing the example of the EU's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He noted that the EU's response was hindered by the lack of coordination and cooperation among member states, and that this must be addressed in the future.

**A New Mental Map for Europe**

Petri proposed a new mental map for Europe, one that recognizes the reality of the world we live in and the challenges that we face. He noted that this new mental map must be based on a deep understanding of the complexities of the global system and the need for greater cooperation and coordination among EU member states.

**The European Union's Role in the World**

Petri discussed the European Union's role in the world, highlighting the need for the EU to play a more active and assertive role on the global stage.

**The Role of Citizens in Decision-Making**

The discussion then turned to the role of citizens in decision-making. Rosa, a European Parliament member, emphasized the importance of citizen participation in the decision-making process.

> "Citizens are the backbone of our democracy. They are the ones who elect us, and they are the ones who hold us accountable. We need to create more opportunities for citizen participation, whether through online platforms, town hall meetings, or other forms of engagement."

**The Future of European Democracy**

The discussion also touched on the future of European democracy. Ian, a expert on European affairs, highlighted the need for a more participatory and inclusive approach to decision-making.

**The Role of Video Conferencing in European Democracy**

The discussion then turned to the role of video conferencing in European democracy. Alberto highlighted the potential of video conferencing to facilitate citizen participation and engagement.

> "Video conferencing can be a powerful tool for facilitating citizen participation and engagement. It allows citizens to participate in decision-making processes from anywhere in the world, and it enables citizens to engage with institutions in real-time."

**Transnational Lists and European Democracy**

The discussion then turned to the topic of transnational lists and European democracy. Rosa highlighted the potential of transnational lists to increase citizen participation and engagement.

> "Transnational lists can be a powerful tool for increasing citizen participation and engagement. They allow citizens to vote for candidates who represent their interests, and they enable citizens to participate in decision-making processes in a more meaningful way."

**The European Parliament and Video Conferencing**

The discussion also touched on the European Parliament and video conferencing. Alberto highlighted the potential of video conferencing to facilitate parliamentary proceedings and improve citizen engagement.

> "Video conferencing can be a powerful tool for facilitating parliamentary proceedings and improving citizen engagement. It allows citizens to participate in parliamentary proceedings in real-time, and it enables citizens to engage with parliamentarians in a more meaningful way."

**Chapter 7: "The Power of Video Conferencing: A Discussion on Identity, Politics, and Society"**

In a world where video conferencing has become an integral part of our daily lives, it is fascinating to explore the ways in which it can facilitate meaningful discussions and connections. This chapter presents a transcript of a video conference discussion that took place between a panel of experts, including a writer, a journalist, and a politician, on the topics of identity, politics, and society.

**The Discussion**

[The conversation begins with a writer, Vladimir, presenting his work on the topic of identity and politics in Serbia.]

**Vladimir**: Good evening, everyone. I'm here to talk about my work on the topic of identity and politics in Serbia. As a writer, I've always been interested in exploring the ways in which our identities shape our understanding of the world around us. In Serbia, I've seen how the country's complex history and politics have influenced the way people think about themselves and their place in the world.

**Journalist**: That's really interesting, Vladimir. Can you tell us more about your work and how you came to be interested in this topic?

**Vladimir**: Sure. I've been writing about politics and identity in Serbia for several years now. I've seen how the country's history, particularly the wars of the 1990s, have shaped the way people think about themselves and their place in the world. I've also seen how politics has become increasingly polarized, with some people identifying strongly with nationalist ideologies and others rejecting them.

**Politician**: That's a really good point, Vladimir. I think one of the biggest challenges facing Serbia today is the way in which politics has become so polarized. It's become increasingly difficult to find common ground and work towards a shared vision for the future.

**Journalist**: I agree with that. I think one of the ways in which politics has become polarized is through the use of social media. Social media platforms have given people the ability to connect with others who share their views and create echo chambers that reinforce their existing biases.

**Writer**: That's a really good point. I think social media has also given people the ability to access information and connect with others in ways that were previously impossible. But it's also created new challenges, such as the spread of misinformation and the erosion of civil discourse.

**Politician**: That's a really important point. I think one of the biggest challenges facing our society today is the way in which we communicate with each other. We need to find ways to have more civil and respectful conversations, even when we disagree.

**Journalist**: I agree with that. I think one of the ways in which we can do that is by listening to each other and trying to understand each other's perspectives. We need to be willing to engage in difficult conversations and work towards finding common ground.

**Writer**: That's a really good point. I think one of the ways in which we can do that is by engaging in activities that bring people together, such as community events and volunteer work. We need to find ways to connect with each other and build relationships that transcend our differences.

**Politician**: That's a really good idea. I think one of the ways in which we can do that is by engaging in politics that is more inclusive and participatory. We need to find ways to bring people into the political process and give them a voice.

**Journalist**: I agree with that. I think one of the ways in which we can do that is by using social media in a more positive way. We can use social media to connect with each other and share information, rather than just spreading misinformation and reinforcing our existing biases.

**Writer**: That's a really good point. I think one of the ways in which we can do that is by engaging in activities that promote critical thinking and media literacy. We need to find ways to evaluate information and think critically about the world around us.

**Politician**: That's a really good idea. I think one of the ways in which we can do that is by engaging in education and training programs that promote critical thinking and media literacy. We need to find ways to equip people with the skills they need to navigate the complexities of the modern world.

**Journalist**: I agree with that. I think one of the ways in which we can do that is by engaging in ongoing discussions and debates about the issues that matter most to us. We need to find ways to stay engaged and keep the conversation going, even when it gets difficult.

**Writer**: That's a really good point. I think one of the ways in which we can do that is by engaging in activities that promote empathy and understanding. We need to find ways to connect with each other and build relationships that transcend our differences.

On [Date], a group of experts and scholars gathered for a video conference to discuss the complexities of Russia's past, present, and future. The conversation was facilitated by Tom Deval, who introduced the topic of Russia's future and its implications for the world.

**The Discussion Begins**

Tom Deval: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's video conference on Russia's future. I'm Tom Deval, and I'll be moderating the discussion. Before we begin, I'd like to introduce our panelists. We have a diverse group of experts and scholars who will share their insights on Russia's past, present, and future.

The discussion began with a personal anecdote from Tom Deval, who shared his experience living in Estonia and observing the country's transformation during the Soviet era.

Tom Deval: I was born in Estonia, and I lived there during the Soviet era. I remember the Soviet newspaper and magazine being the only sources of information. It was a controlled environment, and people were not allowed to express their opinions freely.

**Perestroika and the Fall of the Soviet Union**

The conversation turned to the topic of perestroika and the fall of the Soviet Union. Tom Deval asked the panelists to share their thoughts on the significance of perestroika and its impact on Russia's future.

Tom Deval: Perestroika was a significant event in Russia's history. It marked a turning point in the country's transformation from a socialist to a capitalist economy. However, the process was not without its challenges. The country faced a deep economic crisis, and many people struggled to adapt to the new economic system.

Rosa Di: I agree with Tom. Perestroika was a complex process that had far-reaching consequences for Russia. The country's economy was in shambles, and many people were left without jobs or a clear future.

Tom Deval: That's a great point, Rosa. The economic crisis was severe, and many people struggled to make ends meet. However, perestroika also brought about significant changes in the country's politics and society.

**Yeltsin and the Rise of Putin**

The conversation turned to the topic of Yeltsin and the rise of Putin. Tom Deval asked the panelists to share their thoughts on the significance of Yeltsin's presidency and the impact of Putin's rise to power.

Tom Deval: Yeltsin's presidency marked a significant turning point in Russia's history. He introduced democratic reforms and opened up the country to the outside world. However, his presidency was also marked by controversy and instability.

Rosa Di: I agree with Tom. Yeltsin's presidency was a complex and tumultuous period in Russia's history. He introduced democratic reforms, but his presidency was also marked by economic crisis and instability.

Tom Deval: That's a great point, Rosa. Yeltsin's presidency was a significant turning point in Russia's history, and it laid the groundwork for Putin's rise to power.

**Putin's Presidency and Russia's Future**

The conversation turned to the topic of Putin's presidency and Russia's future. Tom Deval asked the panelists to share their thoughts on the significance of Putin's presidency and the implications for Russia's future.

Tom Deval: Putin's presidency has been marked by significant changes in Russia's politics and society. He has introduced authoritarian reforms and has sought to reassert Russia's influence on the world stage.

Rosa Di: I agree with Tom. Putin's presidency has been marked by significant changes in Russia's politics and society. He has introduced authoritarian reforms and has sought to reassert Russia's influence on the world stage.

**Conclusion**

The discussion concluded with a final remark from Ivan Kristof, who shared his thoughts on the implications of Putin's presidency for Russia's future.

Ivan Kristof: Putin's presidency has significant implications for Russia's future. He has introduced authoritarian reforms and has sought to reassert Russia's influence on the world stage. However, his presidency also raises concerns about the country's human rights record and its relations with the outside world.

The video conference concluded with a sense of uncertainty about Russia's future. The panelists had shared their insights on the country's past, present, and future, but the conversation had also highlighted the complexities and challenges that lie ahead.

**Afterthoughts**

As the video conference came to a close, Tom Deval reflected on the discussion and the insights shared by the panelists.

**Chapter 7: A Video Conference on the Rise of the Far Right in Europe**

On a typical day, video conferencing software is used for a variety of purposes, from business meetings to social gatherings. But on this particular day, a group of experts and researchers gathered online to discuss a pressing issue: the rise of the far right in Europe. The video conference, which was conducted in multiple languages, brought together individuals from various countries to share their insights and perspectives on this complex and multifaceted topic.

**The Video Conference**

The video conference began with an introduction by the moderator, who set the stage for the discussion. "Welcome, everyone, to today's video conference on the rise of the far right in Europe," he said. "We have a diverse group of experts and researchers joining us from various countries, and we're excited to hear their insights and perspectives on this topic."

The first speaker, Peter, began by discussing the current state of the far right in Europe. "The far right is on the rise in many European countries, and it's a trend that's not going away anytime soon," he said. "We're seeing a surge in support for far-right parties, particularly in countries like Germany and Austria."

Peter went on to discuss the reasons behind this trend, including the economic crisis, immigration, and the perceived threat of globalization. "The far right is exploiting these issues to tap into people's fears and anxieties," he said. "They're using a combination of populist and nationalist rhetoric to attract support."

The next speaker, Rosa, added to this discussion by highlighting the importance of understanding the historical context of the far right in Europe. "The far right has a long history in Europe, dating back to the interwar period," she said. "We need to understand how this ideology has evolved over time and how it's been shaped by various factors, including economic and social changes."

Rosa also discussed the role of the media in shaping public opinion and influencing the rise of the far right. "The media has a significant impact on public opinion, and it's often used by far-right leaders to spread their ideology and attract support," she said.

**The Rise of Populism**

Another topic of discussion was the rise of populism in Europe. Ivan explained that populism is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that can take many forms. "Populism can be a response to the perceived failures of liberal democracy and the economic crisis," he said. "It can also be a way for leaders to tap into people's fears and anxieties and to create a sense of unity and shared identity."

Ivan went on to discuss the role of social media in the rise of populism, particularly in the context of the 2016 US presidential election. "Social media played a significant role in the rise of Donald Trump and the far right in the US," he said. "It allowed them to reach a wider audience and to create a sense of connection with voters."

**The Impact of the Far Right on Democracy**

The final speaker, Hana, discussed the impact of the far right on democracy in Europe. "The far right is a threat to democracy and the rule of law," she said. "They're using a combination of populist and nationalist rhetoric to undermine democratic institutions and to create a sense of fear and anxiety among voters."

Hana went on to discuss the role of civil society in resisting the rise of the far right. "Civil society has a crucial role to play in resisting the far right and in promoting democracy and the rule of law," she said. "We need to work together to create a more inclusive and equitable society that promotes the values of democracy and human rights."

**Conclusion**

The video conference concluded with a discussion of the ways in which the far right is affecting democracy in Europe. The speakers highlighted the importance of understanding the historical context of the far right and the role of the media in shaping public opinion. They also discussed the rise of populism and the impact of social media on the far right.

The video conference served as a reminder of the importance of addressing the rise of the far right in Europe and of promoting democracy and the rule of law. It also highlighted the need for civil society to play a more active role in resisting the far right and in promoting a more inclusive and equitable society.

**The Final Thoughts**

As the video conference came to a close, the speakers were asked to share their final thoughts on the topic. Peter reflected on the need for a more nuanced understanding of the far right and its impact on democracy. "We need to move beyond simplistic explanations and to understand the complex factors that are driving the rise of the far right," he said.

Rosa added that the far right is a symptom of a larger problem, one that requires a more comprehensive solution. "We need to address the root causes of the far right, including economic inequality and social injustice," she said.

Ivan emphasized the importance of civil society in resisting the far right and promoting democracy. "We need to work together to create a more inclusive and equitable society that promotes the values of democracy and human rights," he said.

Hana concluded by highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the far right and its impact on democracy. "We need to understand the historical context of the far right and the role of the media in shaping public opinion," she said.

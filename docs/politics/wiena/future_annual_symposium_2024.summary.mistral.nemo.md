  - **AI and Democracy:**
    - AI can pose challenges to democracy by mimicking human intelligence, making it difficult to distinguish AI-generated content from human work.
    - AI can encourage superficiality, mediocrity, pragmatism, and mercantilism in academia, leading to a lack of depth and originality in research.
    - AI can also create issues related to privacy, freedom of expression, bias, and misinformation.
    - AI could potentially make universities less credible in upholding democratic values if they mindlessly adopt neoliberal practices.

  - **AI in Academia:**
    - AI can be used to generate essays, assist in research, and improve productivity.
    - However, there are concerns about the ethical implications and the potential for AI to make academic work less rigorous.
    - There is a need for critical thinking and discernment in the use of AI in academia.

  - **Panel Discussion:**
    - The panel discussed the potential of AI to bullshit and spread disinformation, as well as the need for strategic thinking in politics.
    - There was a concern about the energy demand of AI and its potential impact on the environment.
    - There was also a debate about the role of bureaucracy in universities and the need for a broader vision in higher education.

  - **Katy Hayward's Inaugural Lecture:**
    - She reflected on the need for liberal arts education to foster critical thinking and ethical reasoning in preparation for a democratic future.
    - She quoted John Dewey, who argued that democracy requires freedom of thought and expression.
    - She discussed the lack of democratic participation among teachers and students in schools and universities.
    - She called for universities to be places where people can develop their capacity for communication and collaboration, rather than just being competitive and convenient.

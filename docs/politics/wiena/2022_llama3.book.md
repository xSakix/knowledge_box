He went on to explain that the Amazon rainforest is not just a natural wonder, but a vital component of the global ecosystem. "The Amazon is the lungs of the Earth," he said. "It produces 20% of the world's oxygen and is home to 10% of all known plant and animal species."

However, Rob warned that the Amazon is facing an existential threat due to the rapid expansion of agriculture, mining, and logging. "The current rate of deforestation is unsustainable," he said. "If we don't act now, we risk losing the Amazon forever."

### The Drivers of Deforestation

Rob identified several key drivers of deforestation, including:

* **Agriculture**: The growing demand for soy, beef, and palm oil is driving the clearance of large swaths of land in the Amazon.
* **Mining**: The extraction of gold, copper, and other minerals is another major driver of deforestation.
* **Logging**: The logging industry is also contributing to the destruction of the Amazon, with many trees being harvested for timber and other products.
* **Corruption**: Corruption and lack of enforcement are major obstacles to preventing deforestation, allowing illegal activities to flourish.

### The Consequences of Deforestation

Rob emphasized the devastating consequences of deforestation, including:

* **Climate Change**: Deforestation contributes to climate change by releasing massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
* **Biodiversity Loss**: The destruction of the Amazon is leading to the loss of countless species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth.
* **Indigenous Communities**: Deforestation is also displacing and marginalizing indigenous communities, who have lived in harmony with the forest for centuries.
* **Economic Costs**: Deforestation is estimated to cost the global economy billions of dollars annually, due to the loss of ecosystem services and the degradation of natural resources.

### The Need for Action

Rob emphasized the urgent need for action to address the crisis in the Amazon. "We need to work together to protect the Amazon," he said. "We need to hold governments accountable, we need to support indigenous communities, and we need to change our consumption habits."

He highlighted several potential solutions, including:

* **Reforestation**: Planting new trees and restoring degraded forests is crucial to mitigating the effects of deforestation.
* **Sustainable Agriculture**: Implementing sustainable agriculture practices can help reduce the demand for deforestation.
* **Certification Schemes**: Certifying products as sustainably sourced can help reduce the risk of deforestation.
* **International Cooperation**: International cooperation and agreements are essential for addressing the global nature of the deforestation crisis.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Rob's talk highlighted the gravity of the situation in the Amazon and the need for urgent action. "The Amazon is a ticking time bomb," he said. "If we don't act now, we risk losing the Amazon forever. But if we work together, we can make a difference."

The audience was left with a sense of urgency and a renewed commitment to protecting the Amazon and its inhabitants. The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a powerful reminder of the importance of preserving our planet's natural wonders and the need for collective action to address the pressing issues facing our world.

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a celebration of the city's rich cultural heritage, with a focus on the intersection of philosophy, literature, and mathematics. One of the highlights of the festival was a reenactment of Kurt Gödel's last lecture, a unique and thought-provoking event that brought together scholars, philosophers, and math enthusiasts. The lecture, titled "Gödel's Last Lecture," was a recreation of the famous mathematician's final thoughts on the nature of time, space, and reality.

**The Lecture**

(The scene opens with Kurt Gödel, played by a talented actor, entering the stage. He is frail and weak, but his eyes sparkle with intensity as he begins to speak.)

Gödel: "My dear friends, I am here today to talk to you about something that has puzzled me for many years. The nature of time and space. You see, I have spent my life studying the intricacies of logic and mathematics, and I have come to a realization that may seem strange to some of you. Time and space are not fixed, they are relative."

(The audience is mesmerized by Gödel's words, and they lean in to hear more.)

Gödel: "You see, I have discovered that time and space are not separate entities, but are intertwined. They are like two sides of the same coin. And just as the coin can be flipped, time and space can be flipped, and the universe can be turned upside down."

(The audience is on the edge of their seats, eager to hear more.)

Gödel: "But what does this mean? It means that our understanding of the universe is flawed. It means that we have been living in a world that is not as it seems. A world where time and space are fluid, and where the laws of physics are not absolute."

(The audience is stunned, and they look around at each other in confusion.)

Gödel: "But fear not, my friends. For I have also discovered a way to navigate this new reality. A way to bend the fabric of time and space to our will. It is a difficult task, but it is not impossible."

(The audience is on the edge of their seats, eager to hear more.)

Gödel: "And so, I leave you with a challenge. A challenge to rethink our understanding of the universe, and to explore the possibilities of time and space. For in this new reality, anything is possible."

(The audience erupts into applause as Gödel exits the stage, his words lingering in the air like a challenge.)

**The Q&A Session**

After the lecture, the audience was treated to a Q&A session with the actor who played Gödel, as well as a panel of experts in the fields of mathematics, philosophy, and physics.

**Question:** "How did you prepare for this role?"

**Actor:** "I spent months studying Gödel's work, reading his papers and lectures, and trying to get a sense of his personality and mannerisms. I also worked with a dialect coach to get the Austrian accent just right."

**Question:** "What was it like playing a character who is so intelligent and complex?"

**Actor:** "It was a challenge, but also a privilege. Gödel was a true giant in his field, and it was an honor to bring him to life on stage. I tried to stay true to his spirit and his ideas, while also bringing my own interpretation to the role."

**Question:** "What do you think Gödel would make of the current state of mathematics and physics?"

**Expert:** "Gödel would likely be fascinated by the advances that have been made in these fields. He was a true pioneer, and he would be thrilled to see the progress that has been made. However, he would also likely be critical of the limitations and biases that still exist in these fields."

**Question:** "What do you think Gödel's legacy will be?"

**Expert:** "Gödel's legacy is already immense. He is considered one of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century, and his work has had a profound impact on the development of mathematics and physics. But I think his legacy will only continue to grow as more people learn about his ideas and his work."

**The Aftermath**

As the audience filed out of the theater, they were left to ponder the implications of Gödel's words. The idea that time and space are not fixed, but are relative, was a mind-blowing concept that challenged everything they thought they knew about the universe. The audience was left with a sense of wonder and awe, and a newfound appreciation for the complexity and beauty of the human mind.

As the festival came to a close, the organizers were thrilled with the response to the event. The reenactment of Gödel's last lecture had been a huge success, and the audience had been captivated by the ideas and insights presented. The festival had been a celebration of the power of human curiosity and creativity, and it had left a lasting impression on all who had attended.]

## ANER BARZILAY - The decline of historicity and ist consequences.

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a thought-provoking event that brought together some of the world's most prominent thinkers and scholars to discuss the pressing issues of our time. One of the most memorable sessions was the conversation between Anish Barzillai, a young and brilliant historian, and a distinguished panel of experts on the topic of "The End of History and the Crisis of Historicity." In this chapter, we will explore the transcript of this fascinating discussion.

**The Crisis of Historicity**

Barzillai began by introducing the concept of historicity, which refers to the way we understand and make sense of our place in the world. He argued that the notion of historicity is in crisis, as our traditional narratives and frameworks for understanding the past are no longer sufficient to make sense of the complexities of the present.

"We are living in a time of great uncertainty, where the old certainties no longer hold," Barzillai said. "The notion of historicity is tied to the idea of a linear progression of time, but we are no longer sure what the future holds. We are living in a world where the past is no longer a fixed point, but rather a fluid and constantly changing narrative."

**The End of History**

The panel then turned to the concept of the "End of History," which was first proposed by Francis Fukuyama in the 1990s. Fukuyama argued that the end of the Cold War marked the end of the ideological struggle between capitalism and communism, and that we had reached a point where liberal democracy had become the dominant ideology.

However, Barzillai and the panel argued that this idea is no longer tenable. "The End of History was a myth," Barzillai said. "It was a moment of triumphalism that ignored the complexities of the world. The rise of authoritarian regimes, the decline of liberal democracy, and the increasing importance of non-Western voices have all shown that history is far from over."

**The Rise of Alternative Narratives**

The panel then turned to the rise of alternative narratives and the ways in which these narratives are shaping our understanding of the world. Barzillai argued that the proliferation of social media and other digital platforms has created new spaces for the dissemination of alternative narratives, which are often based on conspiracy theories, nationalism, and other forms of ideological extremism.

"This is a moment of great danger," Barzillai said. "The proliferation of alternative narratives is creating a world where facts are no longer fixed and where truth is relative. We are living in a world where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are increasingly blurred."

**The Role of the Humanities**

The panel then turned to the role of the humanities in addressing the crisis of historicity and the End of History. Barzillai argued that the humanities are essential for helping us make sense of the complexities of the world and for creating a shared understanding of our place in it.

"The humanities are not just about studying the past," Barzillai said. "They are about creating a shared understanding of our place in the world. They are about helping us make sense of the complexities of the present and the uncertainties of the future. In a world where the past is no longer a fixed point, the humanities are more important than ever."

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the conversation between Barzillai and the panel highlighted the complexities and challenges of the crisis of historicity and the End of History. It showed that the traditional narratives and frameworks for understanding the past are no longer sufficient to make sense of the complexities of the present, and that new forms of historical thinking are needed to address the challenges of the 21st century. The role of the humanities in creating a shared understanding of our place in the world is more important than ever, and it is up to us to ensure that they are preserved and promoted.


## VERONIKA MUNK / ANDRÁS SAJÓ - Freedom of Expression redefined.

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 brought together intellectuals, writers, and journalists to discuss the relevance of freedom of expression in the modern world. The panel discussion, moderated by Professor Andrew, featured Veronica, a renowned Hungarian journalist and editor-in-chief of Telex, and a distinguished speaker from the European Court of Human Rights.

### The Decline of Independent Journalism

Veronica began by sharing her personal experience as a journalist in Hungary, where she witnessed the gradual decline of independent journalism. "The Hungarian government has been using various schemes to control the media," she stated. "They have created a system where independent outlets are either bought out by government-friendly businesses or silenced through advertising revenue manipulation."

Professor Andrew added, "This is not unique to Hungary. We're seeing similar trends globally, where governments are using various means to silence independent voices and consolidate power."

Veronica continued, "In Hungary, the government has created a foundation that owns 500 media outlets. It's a vast network of progovernmental media that dominates the market. The remaining independent outlets are struggling to survive, and many have been forced to shut down."

### The Importance of Free Press

Veronica emphasized the importance of a free press in a healthy democracy. "Journalism is not just about reporting the news; it's about holding those in power accountable. Without a free press, there is no check on power, and democracy becomes a farce."

Professor Andrew agreed, "A free press is essential for a functioning democracy. It's the only institution that can hold those in power accountable and ensure that the government is transparent and accountable to the people."

### The Role of Social Media

The discussion turned to the role of social media in shaping public opinion and spreading information. Veronica noted, "Social media has become a major player in the dissemination of information, but it's also a breeding ground for disinformation and manipulation."

Professor Andrew added, "Social media platforms have become so powerful that they can shape public opinion and sway elections. However, they're also responsible for spreading false information and hate speech, which can have devastating consequences."

Veronica emphasized the need for regulation and oversight. "We need to find a way to regulate social media platforms to prevent the spread of misinformation and hate speech. Otherwise, we risk eroding the very fabric of our society."

### The Challenges of Free Speech

The panelists also discussed the challenges of free speech in the modern world. Veronica noted, "Free speech is not just about saying what we want, but also about being able to say what we need to say. Unfortunately, in many countries, including Hungary, the government is using laws and regulations to silence dissenting voices."

Professor Andrew added, "The challenge of free speech is not just about protecting the rights of individuals but also about ensuring that the government is accountable to the people. We need to find a balance between protecting free speech and preventing harm to others."

### The Future of Freedom of Expression

The discussion concluded with a focus on the future of freedom of expression. Veronica emphasized the need for journalists and intellectuals to continue fighting for their rights and speaking truth to power. "We need to be brave and stand up for what we believe in, even in the face of adversity. We need to be willing to take risks and challenge the status quo."

Professor Andrew concluded, "The struggle for freedom of expression is not just a local issue; it's a global issue that requires international cooperation and solidarity. We need to work together to protect the rights of journalists and ensure that the voices of the marginalized are heard."

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 provided a platform for intellectuals and journalists to discuss the importance of freedom of expression in the modern world. The panel discussion highlighted the challenges facing independent journalism and the need for regulation and oversight of social media platforms. The event served as a powerful reminder of the importance of protecting the rights of journalists and ensuring that the voices of the marginalized are heard.


## MARGARET MACMILLAN - Crises past what we have learned

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a thought-provoking and engaging event that brought together some of the world's most renowned scholars and thinkers to discuss the pressing issues of our time. One of the highlights of the festival was a conversation between historian Margaret McMillan and Misha Glenny, Director of the Institute of Human Sciences in Vienna. The conversation, titled "The Ghosts of War," explored the complexities and consequences of war, and the ways in which it continues to shape our world today.

**The Conversation**

Misha Glenny: Good morning, everyone. I'm Misha Glenny, Director of the Institute of Human Sciences in Vienna, and I'm honored to be here today to discuss the theme of "The Ghosts of War" with our distinguished guest, Margaret McMillan. Margaret is a renowned historian and author, and her work has focused on the history of war and its impact on society.

Margaret McMillan: Thank you, Misha. It's a pleasure to be here.

Misha Glenny: Margaret, your latest book, "War and the Human Experience," explores the ways in which war has shaped human society and culture. Can you tell us a bit about your research and what you hope readers will take away from your work?

Margaret McMillan: Sure. My research has focused on the ways in which war has been used to shape and control societies throughout history. I've looked at everything from the ancient Spartans to modern-day conflicts, and I've tried to understand how war has been used as a means of social control, economic development, and even cultural expression.

Misha Glenny: That's fascinating. One of the things that struck me about your work is the way you highlight the ways in which war has been used to shape and control societies. Can you talk a bit more about that?

Margaret McMillan: Yes. I think one of the key ways that war has been used to control societies is through the creation of a sense of collective identity. In times of war, people come together to support a common cause, and that sense of shared purpose can be incredibly powerful. But it can also be used to justify all sorts of atrocities and abuses of power.

Misha Glenny: That's a really important point. And it's something that we're seeing today, with the war in Ukraine and the ways in which it's being used to shape and control public opinion.

Margaret McMillan: Absolutely. I think the war in Ukraine is a great example of how war can be used to shape and control societies. The way that Putin is using the war to justify his own power and to shape public opinion is really fascinating, and it's something that we're seeing all over the world.

Misha Glenny: Yeah. And it's not just Putin, of course. We're seeing it in the West as well, with the way that politicians are using war to shape public opinion and to justify their own policies.

Margaret McMillan: Exactly. And I think that's one of the things that's so important about understanding the history of war. We need to understand how war has been used in the past to shape and control societies, so that we can be more critical of its uses today.

Misha Glenny: That's a great point. And I think it's also important to recognize that war is not just something that happens between nations, but also within them. I mean, we're seeing it right now in the United States, with the way that the left and the right are using war as a means of shaping and controlling public opinion.

Margaret McMillan: Yes. I think that's one of the things that's so complex about war. It's not just something that happens between nations, but also within them. And it's not just a question of good and evil, but also of complex and messy moral choices.

Misha Glenny: That's a great point. And I think it's something that we need to be thinking about more critically, as we navigate the complexities of war today.

Margaret McMillan: Absolutely. And I think that's one of the things that's so important about understanding the history of war. We need to be able to think critically about the ways in which war has been used in the past, so that we can make more informed decisions about how to respond to war today.

Misha Glenny: Well, Margaret, it's been a pleasure talking with you today. Thank you for sharing your insights with us.

Margaret McMillan: Thank you, Misha. It's been a pleasure.

**Conclusion**

The conversation between Misha Glenny and Margaret McMillan was a thought-provoking exploration of the complexities and consequences of war. From the ways in which war has been used to shape and control societies, to the complex moral choices that we face in times of conflict, Margaret McMillan's work offers a nuanced and insightful perspective on the human experience of war. As we continue to navigate the complexities of war today, it is more important than ever that we understand the ways in which war has been used in the past, and that we approach it with a critical and nuanced perspective.


## RONALD DEIBERT - The digital assault of the state on our liberties.

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a celebration of the intersection of art, science, and philosophy. One of the most thought-provoking sessions was a conversation between Ron Deibert, the founder of the Citizen Lab, and Misha Glenny, the director of the Institute for Human Sciences. The topic was the shadow of surveillance, a phenomenon that has become all too familiar in today's digital age.

**The Conversation**

Misha Glenny: Welcome everyone to the opening session of the Vienna Humanities Festival. I'm Misha Glenny, the director of the Institute for Human Sciences, and I'm delighted to introduce our guest speaker, Ron Deibert, the founder of the Citizen Lab.

Ron Deibert: Thank you, Misha. It's a pleasure to be here.

Misha Glenny: Ron is a renowned expert on surveillance and cybersecurity, and his work has exposed some of the most egregious examples of government hacking and espionage. Today, we're going to discuss the shadow of surveillance, and the ways in which it has become a threat to our privacy and our democracy.

Ron Deibert: Thank you, Misha. I'd like to start by talking about the concept of surveillance. We often think of it as a tool of control, used by governments to monitor and manipulate their citizens. But in reality, surveillance is a much more complex and multifaceted phenomenon.

Misha Glenny: Can you elaborate on that?

Ron Deibert: Sure. Surveillance is not just about governments spying on their citizens. It's also about the ways in which corporations and individuals use data to profile and manipulate us. We're living in a world where our every move is being tracked and analyzed, and it's having a profound impact on our sense of privacy and autonomy.

Misha Glenny: That's a chilling thought. What are some examples of this kind of surveillance?

Ron Deibert: Well, there are many. For example, the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies. Or the sale of personal data by corporations to third-party companies. Or the use of spyware to hack into people's phones and computers.

Misha Glenny: Spyware, in particular, is a concern of yours. Can you tell us more about that?

Ron Deibert: Yes, of course. Spyware is a type of malware that is designed to monitor and control people's digital activities. It's often used by governments to spy on dissidents, activists, and journalists. But it's also used by corporations to spy on their employees and customers.

Misha Glenny: That's shocking. What's the most egregious example of spyware you've come across?

Ron Deibert: That's a tough one. But one that stands out is the Pegasus spyware, developed by the Israeli company NSO Group. It's a highly sophisticated piece of malware that can hack into people's phones and computers without their knowledge or consent.

Misha Glenny: And what's the impact of this kind of surveillance on our privacy and our democracy?

Ron Deibert: It's devastating. When people know that their every move is being tracked and monitored, they become fearful of speaking out or expressing themselves freely. It's a form of psychological surveillance that erodes trust and undermines democracy.

Misha Glenny: That's a powerful point. What can we do to combat this kind of surveillance?

Ron Deibert: We need to raise awareness about the issue and push for greater transparency and accountability from governments and corporations. We also need to develop new technologies and strategies to protect our privacy and security.

Misha Glenny: That's a tall order, but it's essential. Thank you, Ron, for shining a light on this critical issue.

Ron Deibert: Thank you, Misha. It's an honor to be here.

**Conclusion**

The conversation between Ron Deibert and Misha Glenny was a sobering reminder of the dangers of surveillance and the importance of protecting our privacy and democracy. As we move forward in this digital age, it's essential that we remain vigilant and push for greater transparency and accountability from those who would seek to control and manipulate us.


## GERTI KAPPEL - Für einen digitalen Humanismus

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a thought-provoking event that brought together experts from various fields to discuss the impact of digitalization on our lives. One of the most insightful conversations was with Gerti Kappel, Professor of Informatics at the Vienna University of Technology, who spoke about the concept of digital humanism and its implications for our society.

**The Concept of Digital Humanism**

Gerti Kappel began by explaining the concept of digital humanism, which she defined as an approach that prioritizes the well-being of humans in the digital age. She emphasized that digital humanism is not just about using technology for the sake of technology, but rather about using it to improve the human condition.

> "Digital humanism is an approach that prioritizes the well-being of humans in the digital age. It's not just about using technology for the sake of technology, but about using it to improve the human condition."

Kappel noted that digital humanism is not a new concept, but rather a reevaluation of the role of technology in our lives. She pointed out that the term "digital humanism" was first coined in the 1990s, and has since been discussed and debated by philosophers, computer scientists, and sociologists.

**The Four Forces of Digital Humanism**

Kappel identified four key forces that are shaping the concept of digital humanism:

1. **Openness**: The principle of openness is fundamental to digital humanism. It refers to the idea that data should be freely accessible and transparent, and that algorithms and data should be open to scrutiny and criticism.
2. **Commercialization**: The commercialization of digital technologies has led to the creation of powerful digital monopolies that have significant influence over our lives. Digital humanism seeks to balance the interests of businesses with the needs of individuals and society as a whole.
3. **Surveillance**: The rise of digital surveillance has raised concerns about privacy and data protection. Digital humanism seeks to strike a balance between the need for surveillance and the need to protect individual privacy.
4. **Interdisciplinarity**: Digital humanism requires an interdisciplinary approach that brings together experts from various fields, including computer science, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. It requires a deep understanding of the complex interactions between technology, society, and human behavior.

**Challenges and Opportunities**

Kappel emphasized that digital humanism is not without its challenges. She noted that the commercialization of digital technologies has led to the creation of powerful digital monopolies that have significant influence over our lives. She also highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of AI systems.

However, Kappel also saw opportunities for digital humanism to improve our lives. She pointed out that digital technologies have the potential to enhance our well-being, improve our health, and increase our productivity. She also emphasized the importance of education and critical thinking in preparing us for the challenges and opportunities of the digital age.

**The Role of Education**

Kappel emphasized the importance of education in preparing us for the challenges and opportunities of the digital age. She noted that education should not only teach us how to use technology, but also how to think critically about its impact on our lives. She also emphasized the need for interdisciplinary education that brings together experts from various fields to address the complex challenges of the digital age.

> "Education should not only teach us how to use technology, but also how to think critically about its impact on our lives. We need to educate ourselves to be responsible digital citizens."

**The Way Forward**

Kappel concluded by emphasizing the need for a collaborative approach to digital humanism. She noted that it will require the efforts of governments, businesses, educators, and individuals to create a more just and equitable digital society. She also emphasized the importance of ongoing research and debate to address the complex challenges and opportunities of the digital age.

> "Digital humanism is a journey, not a destination. It requires ongoing research, debate, and collaboration to create a more just and equitable digital society."

In conclusion, Gerti Kappel's conversation at the Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 provided a thought-provoking perspective on the concept of digital humanism and its implications for our society. Her insights highlight the need for a collaborative approach to digital humanism, one that balances the interests of businesses with the needs of individuals and society as a whole.

**The Digital Humanism of the Future**

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a thought-provoking event that brought together scholars, researchers, and experts from various fields to discuss the future of humanism in the digital age. One of the keynote speakers, delivered a captivating address that explored the concept of digital humanism and its implications for our society. This chapter presents the transcript of the keynote address, which is reprinted with permission from the Vienna Humanities Festival 2022.

**The Concept of Digital Humanism**

To begin with, we defined digital humanism as a philosophical approach that seeks to understand the human condition in the age of digital technologies. She emphasized that digital humanism is not just about using technology, but rather about understanding the human implications of these technologies and their impact on our society.

"We need to understand that we are not just users of digital technologies, but also creators of them," was said. "We need to take responsibility for the kind of digital world we want to create, and that requires a deep understanding of the human condition in the digital age."

**The Importance of Digital Literacy**

Kappel highlighted the importance of digital literacy in the context of digital humanism. She argued that digital literacy is not just about being able to use digital technologies, but also about being able to critically evaluate the information we consume online.

"We need to teach people how to think critically about the information they encounter online, and how to evaluate the credibility of sources," Kappel emphasized. "We need to encourage people to question the information they are presented with, and to seek out multiple sources of information before forming an opinion."

**The Impact of Algorithms on Society**

Kappel also discussed the impact of algorithms on society, particularly in the context of social media. She argued that algorithms are not neutral, and that they can perpetuate biases and reinforce existing social structures.

"We need to be aware of the algorithms that shape our online experiences, and we need to demand transparency and accountability from the companies that design and implement these algorithms," Kappel said. "We need to ensure that these algorithms are fair and equitable, and that they do not perpetuate biases or reinforce existing social structures."

**The Future of Work and Education**

Kappel also touched on the future of work and education in the context of digital humanism. She argued that the rise of automation and artificial intelligence will require us to rethink our approach to education and employment.

"We need to focus on developing skills that are complementary to automation, such as critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence," Kappel emphasized. "We need to provide people with the education and training they need to thrive in a rapidly changing world, and we need to ensure that everyone has access to these opportunities."

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, Kappel's keynote address at the Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a thought-provoking exploration of the concept of digital humanism. She emphasized the importance of digital literacy, the impact of algorithms on society, and the need to rethink our approach to education and employment in the context of the digital age. Her address was a powerful reminder of the need for us to take responsibility for the kind of digital world we want to create, and to work towards a future that is equitable, just, and humane.


## OLESYA KHROMEYCHUK  - Telling ukrainian stories in the ninth year of war

**Introduction**

On a sunny afternoon in Vienna, the Humanities Festival 2022 brought together scholars, writers, and thinkers to discuss the complexities of war, identity, and the human experience. Among the esteemed speakers was Alessia Romichok, a Ukrainian historian and writer, who shared her insights on the ongoing war in Ukraine and its implications on the world. This chapter is a transcript of her conversation at the festival.

**The War in Ukraine: A Personal Perspective**

Alessia Romichok began her talk by sharing her personal experience of growing up in Ukraine, where she witnessed the war unfold from its early stages. She spoke of her brother, Velodia, who had joined the Ukrainian Army in 2015, motivated by a sense of patriotism and a desire to defend his country. "I didn't understand why he was going to fight," she said. "I thought he was just going to go and come back. But he didn't come back."

Romichok's brother was killed in action in 2017, and his death had a profound impact on her life. She struggled to come to terms with the loss and the senseless violence that had taken her brother's life. "I couldn't understand why people were dying," she said. "I couldn't understand why my brother was dying."

As she began to write about her experiences, Romichok discovered that her story was not unique. She found that many Ukrainians were living through similar experiences, struggling to make sense of the war and its devastating consequences. "I realized that I wasn't alone," she said. "I wasn't the only one who had lost someone. I wasn't the only one who was struggling to understand."

**The Power of Storytelling**

Romichok's writing became a way for her to process her emotions and make sense of the war. She began to write about her brother, about the people she had met during her research, and about the stories she had heard. "Storytelling is a powerful tool," she said. "It's a way to connect with others, to share our experiences, and to understand each other's perspectives."

Through her writing, Romichok aimed to humanize the conflict and to highlight the stories of those affected by it. She believed that by sharing these stories, she could help to break down stereotypes and to foster empathy and understanding. "I want people to see that this is not just a war between Ukraine and Russia," she said. "This is a war that affects human beings, that affects families, that affects communities."

**The Importance of Empathy**

Romichok emphasized the importance of empathy in understanding the conflict. She believed that empathy was essential for building bridges between different cultures and for promoting peace. "Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes," she said. "It's the ability to understand their pain, their fear, their hope. And it's the ability to do something about it."

Romichok's work is a testament to the power of empathy. Her writing has reached out to people from all over the world, connecting them with the stories and experiences of Ukrainians affected by the war. "I've received messages from people who have been touched by my writing," she said. "People who have been inspired to take action, to support Ukraine, to stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people. And that's what it's all about. That's what storytelling is all about."

**The Future of Ukraine**

As the conversation came to a close, Romichok reflected on the future of Ukraine. She spoke of the challenges that lay ahead, from rebuilding the country to addressing the trauma and displacement caused by the war. But she also spoke of hope and resilience, of the Ukrainian people's ability to overcome adversity and to rebuild their lives.

Romichok concluded by emphasizing the importance of continued support for Ukraine. She urged the international community to stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people, to provide aid and assistance, and to promote peace and understanding. "The war in Ukraine is not just a Ukrainian problem," she said. "It's a global problem. And it requires a global response."

**Conclusion**

Alessia Romichok's conversation at the Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a powerful reminder of the importance of storytelling, empathy, and solidarity. Her work is a testament to the human spirit's ability to overcome adversity and to find hope in the darkest of times. As we continue to navigate the complexities of war and conflict, Romichok's words serve as a powerful reminder of the need for understanding, compassion, and action.


## ECE TEMELKURAN - Fascism hide from it, fight against it what else

Misha Glenny, director and co-organizer of the Vienna Humanities Festival, welcomed the audience to the latest session of the festival, featuring Edge, an extremely well-known writer and political commentator, particularly from Turkey. Edge has written for The Guardian, The New York Times, and Spiegel, among others. She is also a recognized commentator on Turkish politics.

---

**Misha Glenny**: Hey everyone, I'm Misha Glenny, director and co-organizer of the Vienna Humanities Festival. I'm thrilled to introduce our next speaker, Edge, a renowned writer and political commentator from Turkey. Edge has written for The Guardian, The New York Times, and Spiegel, among others. She's also a recognized commentator on Turkish politics. Let's dive into her thoughts on fascism, politics, and the power of storytelling.

**Edge**: Thank you, Misha. I'm honored to be here.

**Misha Glenny**: So, let's start with your book, "Lose Country, Seven Steps to Democracy and Dictatorship". Can you tell us a bit about that?

**Edge**: Sure. The book is about the rise of populist leaders and the erosion of democracy. I drew parallels between Turkey and other countries, including the UK and the US, to identify common patterns. The title refers to the seven steps that lead from democracy to dictatorship. The book is not just about Turkey; it's a warning sign for the world.

**Misha Glenny**: That's fascinating. You've written about the Turkish coup attempt in 2016. Can you tell us more about that experience?

**Edge**: Yes, it was a traumatic event. I was in Turkey when it happened. I remember the sound of fighter jets flying low over the city, the feeling of fear and uncertainty. It was like a scene from a movie. The coup attempt was a turning point for me, and I realized that I had to write about it.

**Misha Glenny**: Your book also touches on the theme of femininity and fascism. Can you elaborate on that?

**Edge**: Yes, I've always been interested in the role of women in politics and the way they're often marginalized or co-opted by fascist movements. In Turkey, for example, there are many women who have risen to power within the fascist movement, often using their femininity to gain support. It's a complex issue, and I tried to explore it in my book.

**Misha Glenny**: That's a crucial topic. You've also written about the rise of right-wing populism in Europe. What do you think is driving this trend?

**Edge**: I think it's a combination of factors. One is the economic crisis, which has created a sense of uncertainty and insecurity among people. Another is the rise of social media, which has created a platform for populist leaders to spread their messages and manipulate public opinion. And finally, there's a growing sense of nostalgia for a lost era, often linked to nationalism and xenophobia.

**Misha Glenny**: Those are all valid points. You've also spoken about the importance of storytelling in politics. Can you tell us more about that?

**Edge**: Storytelling is crucial in politics. Populist leaders are masters of storytelling, using narratives to create a sense of identity and community. But we, as critics and intellectuals, also need to use storytelling to counter these narratives and offer alternative visions for the future.

**Misha Glenny**: That's a great point. Finally, what message do you hope audiences take away from your book and your talks?

**Edge**: I hope that people will understand the dangers of fascism and the importance of resisting it. I also hope that they'll be inspired to use their own stories and experiences to create a more just and equitable world.

---

**Audience Q&A**

**Misha Glenny**: Thank you, Edge, for sharing your insights with us today. Now, let's open the floor for questions.

**Audience Member 1**: Edge, can you speak more about the role of the media in shaping public opinion?

**Edge**: Yes, the media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion. Unfortunately, many media outlets have become complicit in spreading propaganda and misinformation. We need to hold them accountable and demand more responsible reporting.

**Audience Member 2**: How can we, as individuals, resist the rise of fascism?

**Edge**: There are many ways to resist. One is to educate ourselves about history and the dangers of fascism. Another is to engage in activism and community organizing. And finally, we need to support marginalized voices and challenge dominant narratives.

**Audience Member 3**: You've written about the importance of hope in the face of darkness. Can you share a personal experience that illustrates that?

**Edge**: Ah, yes. After the coup attempt, I was in a state of panic and despair. But then I realized that I had to find a way to keep telling the story, to keep spreading hope and resistance. That experience taught me the power of resilience and the importance of holding onto hope, even in the darkest of times.

---

**Conclusion**

As the session came to a close, Edge's words of wisdom and warning resonated with the audience. Her book, "Lose Country, Seven Steps to Democracy and Dictatorship", is a must-read for anyone concerned about the rise of fascism and the erosion of democracy. Her insights into the role of storytelling, femininity, and the media in shaping public opinion are crucial for us to understand the complex issues we face today. As we continue to navigate these uncertain times, Edge's message of hope and resistance serves as a beacon of light, inspiring us to create a more just and equitable world.

## CARLOS F. FRAENKEL - Inwiefern hilft uns die antike Philosophie in Zeiten der Unsicherheit?

**Teaching, Philosophy, and the Pursuit of Happiness**
=============================================

At the Vienna Humanities Festival 2022, I had the pleasure of sitting down with Carlos Franklin, a renowned philosopher and professor at Mcgill University in Montreal. Our conversation was a thought-provoking exploration of the intersections between philosophy, teaching, and the human experience. As we sipped coffee and discussed the intricacies of philosophy, Carlos shared his latest book project, which delves into the relevance of ancient philosophical schools in today's world.

### The Project

Carlos's book, currently in the writing process, is an exploration of the various philosophical schools of thought, from Stoicism to Epicureanism, and their relevance to modern-day problems. He plans to write a textbook that will not only introduce readers to these ancient philosophical concepts but also challenge them to think critically about their own values and assumptions.

The book will be divided into two parts. The first part will cover the different philosophical schools, using a narrative approach to bring the thinkers and their ideas to life. The second part will delve deeper into the implications of these philosophical concepts for our modern lives, encouraging readers to reflect on their own values and the way they shape their decisions.

### The Importance of Philosophy

Carlos emphasized the importance of philosophy in today's world, where many people are searching for answers to life's big questions. "Philosophy is not just about abstract ideas," he said. "It's about living a good life, and that's what people are looking for. They want to know how to make sense of their lives, how to find happiness and fulfillment."

He also highlighted the significance of teaching philosophy in a way that is accessible and engaging, citing the example of his own teaching practice. "I try to make philosophy relevant to my students' lives," he explained. "I want them to see that philosophy is not just something abstract, but something that can be applied to their everyday experiences."

### The Role of Ancient Philosophy

Carlos believes that ancient philosophy has much to offer in today's world, despite the many changes that have taken place since ancient times. "Ancient philosophers were grappling with the same fundamental questions that we are today," he said. "They were trying to make sense of the world, to find meaning and purpose in life. Their ideas may not be directly applicable to our modern context, but the questions they raised are still relevant."

He cited the example of Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia, or happiness, as a particularly relevant idea. "Aristotle believed that happiness is not just a fleeting pleasure, but a long-term state of being that arises from living a virtuous life," Carlos explained. "This idea is still relevant today, as people are searching for a deeper sense of fulfillment and happiness."

### The Paradox of Subjective Value

As we discussed the importance of philosophy and the role of ancient philosophy in today's world, Carlos touched on the paradox of subjective value. "Subjective values are a fundamental aspect of human experience," he said. "We create our own values, and they are not necessarily shared by others. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and isolation, as we struggle to find common ground with others."

He used the example of photo albums to illustrate this point. "Photo albums are a personal and subjective reflection of our experiences and memories," he said. "They may not be meaningful to others, but they are crucial to our own sense of identity and happiness. This is a fundamental aspect of human nature, and it's something that philosophers have grappled with for centuries."

### The Pursuit of Happiness

As our conversation drew to a close, Carlos reflected on the pursuit of happiness and the role of philosophy in that pursuit. "Philosophy is not just about finding answers to life's big questions," he said. "It's about living a good life, and that's what people are looking for. They want to know how to make sense of their lives, how to find happiness and fulfillment."

He emphasized the importance of critical thinking and self-reflection in this pursuit. "We need to be willing to question our own assumptions and values," he said. "We need to be open to new ideas and perspectives, and willing to challenge our own biases and prejudices. This is the key to living a good life, and it's what philosophy is all about."

As our conversation came to a close, I was struck by the depth and richness of Carlos's insights. His passion for philosophy is infectious, and his commitment to sharing it with others is inspiring. As we parted ways, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to engage with such a thoughtful and engaging thinker.
# Vienna Humanities Festival 2022: A Journey of Ideas

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a celebration of the arts, sciences, and humanities, bringing together scholars, artists, and thinkers from around the world to explore the complexities of human existence. One of the highlights of the festival was the talk by a renowned philosopher, who shared his thoughts on the importance of liberal values and the challenges of promoting them in a rapidly changing world.

**The Power of Liberal Values**

The philosopher began his talk by emphasizing the significance of liberal values in shaping our understanding of the world. He argued that liberal values are not just about individual freedom, but also about the importance of dialogue, tolerance, and mutual respect. He drew parallels between the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, where the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom was seen as a fundamental aspect of human existence.

"In the ancient world, the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom was seen as a fundamental aspect of human existence," he said. "The Greeks and Romans saw the pursuit of wisdom as a way to achieve a better life, a life of virtue and happiness. And they believed that this pursuit was not just for individuals, but for the community as well."

The philosopher went on to discuss the importance of dialogue and tolerance in promoting liberal values. He argued that dialogue is essential for understanding different perspectives and fostering a culture of mutual respect.

"Dialogue is not just about exchanging information, but about understanding each other's perspectives," he said. "It's about listening to each other, and being open to change. And it's about recognizing that we all have different values and beliefs, and that's what makes us human."

**Challenges of Promoting Liberal Values**

The philosopher also acknowledged the challenges of promoting liberal values in a rapidly changing world. He argued that the rise of populism and nationalism has led to a growing intolerance of different perspectives, and that this has created a sense of uncertainty and insecurity.

"We're living in a world where people are increasingly polarized, and where the lines between right and wrong are becoming increasingly blurred," he said. "We're seeing the rise of populism and nationalism, and this has led to a growing intolerance of different perspectives. And this is creating a sense of uncertainty and insecurity, which is making it harder for people to engage in dialogue and to promote liberal values."

Despite these challenges, the philosopher remained optimistic about the future of liberal values. He argued that the key to promoting liberal values is to educate people about the importance of dialogue, tolerance, and mutual respect.

"We need to educate people about the importance of dialogue and tolerance, and about the need to listen to each other and to be open to change," he said. "We need to promote a culture of mutual respect, where people feel comfortable sharing their perspectives and engaging in dialogue. And we need to recognize that we all have different values and beliefs, and that's what makes us human."

**A Personal Reflection**

The philosopher also shared a personal reflection on his own journey of discovery, and how he came to realize the importance of liberal values.

"I grew up in a family that was deeply divided by politics," he said. "My parents were both intellectuals, and they had very different views on politics. And as a result, I grew up in a household where there was a lot of tension and conflict. But as I grew older, I began to realize that our differences were not as important as our common humanity. And I realized that we all share a desire for a better life, a life of happiness and fulfillment. And that's when I began to see the importance of liberal values, and the need to promote them in our society."

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the philosopher's talk was a powerful reminder of the importance of liberal values in shaping our understanding of the world. He emphasized the significance of dialogue, tolerance, and mutual respect in promoting liberal values, and acknowledged the challenges of doing so in a rapidly changing world. Despite these challenges, he remained optimistic about the future of liberal values, and emphasized the need to educate people about the importance of dialogue and tolerance.

The talk was a fitting conclusion to the Vienna Humanities Festival 2022, which celebrated the power of ideas and the importance of promoting liberal values in a rapidly changing world.



## LEA YPI - Freiheit im Übergang (und warum sie kein Übergang zur Freiheit war)

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a celebration of ideas, culture, and intellectual curiosity. One of the highlights of the festival was a conversation between the esteemed professor of political theory, Lea Ypi, and a moderator, discussing her latest book, "Free Coming Age". The conversation was a fascinating exploration of the concept of freedom, its meaning, and its implications in a rapidly changing world.

### The Power of Storytelling

The conversation began with a discussion on the power of storytelling in shaping our understanding of freedom. Lea Ypi shared a personal anecdote about her childhood in Albania during the communist era, where she grew up believing that Albania was the freest country in the world. She recalled how her cousin, who had never left Albania, would talk about Italy with a deep longing, and how this sparked her curiosity about the world beyond her borders.

The moderator asked Ypi to elaborate on this idea, and she explained that storytelling has the power to shape our understanding of reality. She cited the example of the Eurovision Song Contest, where Albania's participation in 1990 was a moment of great excitement and hope. The song, performed by Toto Cutugno, was a symbol of freedom and unity, but it also marked the beginning of a new era of disillusionment and disappointment.

### The Illusion of Freedom

Ypi's book, "Free Coming Age", explores the concept of freedom and its relationship to ideology. She argued that freedom is often an illusion, and that it is not just about individual choices, but also about the systemic structures that shape our lives. She cited the example of the Albanian people, who were promised freedom and democracy after the fall of communism, but were instead faced with a new set of challenges and inequalities.

The moderator asked Ypi to elaborate on this idea, and she explained that the concept of freedom is often used as a justification for Western liberal democracy. She argued that this approach is paternalistic, assuming that Western societies have a monopoly on knowledge and that other cultures are inferior. Ypi emphasized the need to listen to the stories and experiences of others, rather than imposing our own narratives on them.

### The Crisis of Liberalism

The conversation turned to the crisis of liberalism and its implications for our understanding of freedom. Ypi argued that liberalism has become a form of dogma, and that it has failed to address the systemic inequalities and injustices that persist in our societies. She cited the example of the 2008 financial crisis, which showed that the market is not a self-regulating system, and that it requires government intervention to function.

The moderator asked Ypi to elaborate on this idea, and she explained that the crisis of liberalism is not just about economic policy, but also about the values and principles that underpin our societies. She argued that we need to rethink our understanding of freedom and its relationship to equality, and to recognize that freedom is not just about individual choices, but also about collective action and social justice.

### The Power of Dissent

The conversation concluded with a discussion on the power of dissent and its role in shaping our understanding of freedom. Ypi emphasized the importance of critical thinking and intellectual curiosity, and the need to challenge dominant narratives and ideologies. She cited the example of the dissident movements of the 1980s, which challenged the communist regime in Albania and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.

The moderator asked Ypi to elaborate on this idea, and she explained that dissent is not just about opposing the status quo, but also about creating new possibilities and alternatives. She argued that we need to recognize the value of dissent and to create spaces for critical thinking and debate, rather than silencing those who challenge our assumptions and beliefs.

**The Author's Perspective**

The author, who wished to remain anonymous, began by sharing their personal experiences growing up in Albania under communist rule. They spoke about the restrictions on freedom of speech, the lack of transparency, and the constant feeling of being watched. Despite the difficulties, the author's family managed to find ways to resist and maintain a sense of freedom within their own lives.

**The Power of Family**

The author emphasized the importance of family in maintaining a sense of freedom and identity. They spoke about how their grandmother, who was a communist party member, would often speak to them in French, a language she had learned during her time in France. This seemed strange to the author, but it was a way for their grandmother to connect with them and maintain a sense of freedom.

**The Illusion of Freedom**

The author also spoke about the illusion of freedom that came with the collapse of communism. They described how people thought that freedom meant being able to travel, to have more money, and to be able to make choices. However, this freedom was often an illusion, as people were still trapped in a system that was controlled by the government.

**The European Union**

The author criticized the European Union for its lack of transparency and its emphasis on economic freedom over human rights. They spoke about how the EU's conditionality policy, which requires countries to meet certain economic criteria in order to join the union, is often used as a way to control and manipulate smaller countries.

**The Need for a New Approach**

The author emphasized the need for a new approach to freedom and the European Union. They spoke about the importance of recognizing the experiences and perspectives of people from Eastern Europe, who have been marginalized and excluded from the conversation. They also emphasized the need for a more inclusive and transparent approach to decision-making.

**The Moderator's Questions**

The moderator asked several questions to clarify the author's points and to encourage further discussion. They asked about the relationship between freedom and responsibility, and how people can balance their individual freedom with the needs of society.

**The Author's Response**

The author responded by saying that freedom is not just about individual rights, but also about collective responsibility. They emphasized the importance of recognizing the interconnectedness of all people and the need for collective action to create a more just and equitable society.

**The Power of Storytelling**

The author also spoke about the power of storytelling in shaping our understanding of freedom. They emphasized the importance of sharing personal experiences and perspectives, and how this can help to create a more nuanced and compassionate understanding of the world.

**Conclusion**

The conversation between the author and the moderator was a powerful exploration of the complex and multifaceted concept of freedom. It highlighted the need for a more inclusive and transparent approach to decision-making, and the importance of recognizing the experiences and perspectives of all people. The conversation also emphasized the power of storytelling in shaping our understanding of the world, and the need for collective action to create a more just and equitable society.


## DIRK KURBJUWEIT, JOHANNA LUTZ - Identität, Parteilichkeit, Polasrisierung


The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022, a premier event in the city's cultural calendar, brought together some of the world's most renowned scholars, thinkers, and politicians to discuss the state of democracy in the modern world. One of the most thought-provoking sessions was a panel discussion on identitarian politics and polarization, featuring renowned journalist and author, DIRK KURBJUWEIT, and Dr. Johanna Lutz, Director of the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung in Vienna.

**The Discussion Begins**

The panel began with a brief introduction by DIRK KURBJUWEIT, who set the tone for the discussion by highlighting the growing concern over the state of democracy worldwide. "We are witnessing a crisis of democracy," he said. "Polarization is on the rise, and identitarian politics are becoming increasingly prevalent. We need to understand why this is happening and what we can do to mitigate its effects."

Dr. Lutz then took the floor, presenting the findings of a recent study on identitarian politics and polarization in Europe. "Our research suggests that identitarian politics are not limited to a particular ideology or party," she explained. "Rather, they are a broader phenomenon that cuts across party lines. We found that even in countries with strong traditions of democratic governance, there is a growing trend towards polarization and identitarianism."

**The Role of Emotions in Politics**

The discussion then turned to the role of emotions in politics. DIRK KURBJUWEIT noted that emotions have always played a significant role in political decision-making, but that in recent years, they have become increasingly prominent. "Emotions are a powerful driver of political behavior," he said. "They can motivate people to act in ways that are not necessarily rational or well-informed."

Dr. Lutz agreed, citing the example of the 2016 US presidential election. "The election of Donald Trump was a perfect storm of emotions," she said. "Fear, anger, and anxiety drove many people to vote for him, despite his questionable policy proposals."

**The Power of Identity**

The panel then turned to the concept of identity and its role in shaping political beliefs and behaviors. Dr. Lutz noted that identity is a fundamental aspect of human experience, and that it plays a crucial role in shaping our political attitudes and behaviors. "Our identities are closely tied to our sense of belonging and our sense of self," she said. "When we feel threatened or marginalized, we are more likely to turn to identitarian politics as a way of defending our interests and asserting our identities."

**Polarization and the Media**

The discussion then turned to the role of the media in perpetuating polarization. DIRK KURBJUWEIT noted that the media has long been accused of contributing to the erosion of trust in institutions and the rise of polarization. "The media has a responsibility to report the news fairly and accurately," he said. "But all too often, we see sensationalized headlines and biased reporting that reinforces existing divisions and amplifies extremist views."

Dr. Lutz agreed, citing the example of social media. "Social media has created a culture of outrage and polarization," she said. "Platforms like Facebook and Twitter are designed to maximize engagement and clicks, which can lead to the amplification of extremist views and the silencing of dissenting voices."

**The Future of Democracy**

The panel concluded with a discussion on the future of democracy. DIRK KURBJUWEIT noted that the current state of affairs is not sustainable, and that we need to find ways to address the underlying causes of polarization and identitarian politics. "We need to find ways to build bridges across the divides that are tearing us apart," he said. "We need to foster a culture of empathy and understanding, and we need to promote education and critical thinking."

Dr. Lutz agreed, citing the importance of civic education and media literacy. "We need to educate citizens about the importance of democratic values and the dangers of identitarian politics," she said. "We need to promote media literacy and critical thinking, so that people can make informed decisions and resist the manipulation of information."

**The Power of Populism**

The expert, a seasoned journalist, began by highlighting the key characteristics of populism. "Populism is a political movement that appeals to the emotions of the people, often using simplistic and demagogic language," he explained. "It's a phenomenon that has been observed in many countries, including Austria, where we have seen the rise of right-wing populist parties."

He emphasized that populism is not a new phenomenon, but rather a recurring theme in human history. "Throughout history, we have seen examples of populism, from ancient Greece to modern times. It's a way of appealing to the masses, often by playing on their fears, desires, and emotions."

**The Role of the Media**

The journalist also touched on the role of the media in perpetuating populism. "The media has a significant impact on the way we perceive the world and the issues that affect us," he said. "In recent years, we have seen a shift towards sensationalism and clickbait headlines, which can create a sense of chaos and uncertainty. This can be exploited by populists, who use these feelings to create a sense of urgency and crisis."

He also noted that the media's focus on opinion over fact-checking has contributed to the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories. "The 24-hour news cycle and social media have created an environment where information is disseminated quickly, but often without fact-checking or critical analysis. This has allowed populists to spread false information and create a sense of doubt and uncertainty."

**Polarization and the Decline of Democracy**

The journalist warned that the rise of populism and polarization poses a significant threat to democracy. "Polarization is a natural phenomenon, but when it becomes extreme, it can lead to a breakdown of democratic institutions and the erosion of trust in government," he said. "We have seen this in many countries, including the United States, where political polarization has become so extreme that it is difficult to find common ground."

He emphasized that the decline of democracy is not just a matter of politics, but also of culture and education. "Democracy requires a certain level of civic engagement and participation, which is often lacking in today's society. We need to educate ourselves and our children about the importance of democratic values and the dangers of populism."

**The Need for Critical Thinking**

The journalist concluded by emphasizing the need for critical thinking in the face of populism and polarization. "We need to be critical thinkers, able to separate fact from fiction and to evaluate information objectively," he said. "We need to be aware of the manipulative tactics used by populists and to resist their appeals to our emotions. We need to educate ourselves and others about the dangers of populism and to promote a culture of critical thinking and civic engagement."

**Conclusion**

The discussion on populism and polarization at the Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a powerful reminder of the importance of critical thinking and civic engagement in today's society. The expert's insights highlighted the need for a nuanced understanding of the phenomenon of populism and its consequences, as well as the importance of promoting democratic values and institutions. As we navigate the complexities of our globalized world, it is crucial that we remain vigilant and committed to the principles of democracy, critical thinking, and civic engagement.



## STEFAN CREUZBERGER - Deutsche und Russen im langen 20.Jahrhundert.

**Moderator:** Good morning, welcome to the Vienna Humanities Festival 2022. Today, we have the pleasure of hosting Stefan Kreutzberger, a renowned historian and professor at the University of Rostock. He has written extensively on the history of Germany and Russia, and his latest book, "The German-Russian Century," has sparked lively debate and discussion among scholars and policymakers alike. Today, we'll be discussing his book and its implications for our understanding of the complex relationship between Germany and Russia.

**Stefan Kreutzberger:** Good morning, thank you for having me.

**Moderator:** Let's start with your book, "The German-Russian Century." Can you tell us a bit about what inspired you to write it?

**Stefan Kreutzberger:** Well, I've always been fascinated by the complex and often tumultuous history between Germany and Russia. From the Rapallo Treaty in 1922 to the present day, their relationship has been marked by periods of cooperation and conflict. I wanted to explore this century-long history and examine the ways in which it has shaped the two countries and the world.

**Moderator:** Your book challenges some of the conventional wisdom about the relationship between Germany and Russia. Can you tell us more about that?

**Stefan Kreutzberger:** Yes, certainly. One of the key arguments I make in the book is that the traditional narrative of Germany's Ostpolitik, or Eastern policy, as a series of failed attempts to curry favor with the Soviet Union, is oversimplified. In reality, Germany's policy was often driven by a desire to balance its relations with the Soviet Union and the West, and to maintain its independence and sovereignty.

**Moderator:** That's a fascinating perspective. Can you speak more about the role of the Rapallo Treaty in this context?

**Stefan Kreutzberger:** The Rapallo Treaty is often seen as a symbol of Germany's submission to the Soviet Union, but I argue that it was actually a clever move by Germany to gain recognition as a sovereign state and to establish a partnership with the Soviet Union that would allow it to balance its relations with the West. Of course, the treaty ultimately failed to prevent the rise of Nazi Germany and the outbreak of World War II, but in the context of the time, it was a savvy move by Germany.

**Moderator:** That's a compelling argument. What about the post-war period? How did Germany's relations with Russia evolve after the war?

**Stefan Kreutzberger:** After the war, Germany's relations with Russia were marked by a period of détente, which culminated in the signing of the Treaty of Moscow in 1970. This treaty established a framework for cooperation between the two countries, including trade and cultural exchanges. Of course, the relationship was not without its challenges, but it was a significant step forward in terms of reducing tensions between the two countries.

**Moderator:** That's a interesting point. Can you speak more about the impact of the fall of the Soviet Union on the relationship between Germany and Russia?

**Stefan Kreutzberger:** I think we need to consider the historical context. The Soviet Union's collapse was a traumatic event, and many Russians still feel the effects of that collapse. The government's actions may be authoritarian, but they're also a response to the perceived threats from the West. We must acknowledge the fears and anxieties that drive these policies.

**Moderator:** An excellent point, Dr. [Name]. But what about the role of the German government in all this? Have we done enough to support the Russian Academy and its scholars?

**Stefan Kreutzberger:** Ah, that's a crucial question. Germany has been vocal in its criticism of Russia's human rights abuses and censorship, but we can do more to support the Russian Academy. We need to provide scholarships, research grants, and a platform for Russian scholars to share their work. We must also recognize that the Russian Academy is not a monolithic entity; there are many voices and perspectives within it that we can support.

**Stefan Kreutzberger:** I agree. The German government can play a crucial role in promoting academic freedom and exchange. We need to establish programs that bring Russian scholars to Germany and provide opportunities for collaboration. This will help to build bridges and foster a deeper understanding between our nations.

**Moderator:** That's a great idea. What about the role of social media and the internet in shaping public discourse and influencing policy decisions?

**Stefan Kreutzberger:** Ah, that's a critical issue. Social media has become a powerful tool for spreading disinformation and propaganda. We need to be aware of these biases and take steps to counter them. The Russian Academy is not immune to these challenges, and we need to work together to promote fact-based research and reporting.

I think we're seeing a resurgence of old Soviet-era tactics, where the government uses propaganda to shape public opinion. We need to be vigilant and fact-check information carefully. The Russian Academy must also take responsibility for promoting critical thinking and academic integrity.

**Moderator:** Thank you, panelists, for sharing your insights.


## VELINA TCHAKAROVA, ANDREAS TREICHL - Wirtschaft und Sicherheit im neuen Europa.

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a gathering of minds that sought to make sense of the chaotic world we live in. One of the most thought-provoking panels was the discussion on the shattered global order and the future of Europe. Moderated by Josef Gepp, a journalist from the Austrian newspaper Standard, the panel featured Sofia Tschako, a scholar of political science, and Andreas Treichl, the President of the European Forum Alpbach.

**The Systemic Crisis**

Gepp began by acknowledging that the world has changed dramatically since the fall of the Soviet Union. "We are now facing a system-wide crisis," he said. "The Russian invasion of Ukraine has not only destroyed the European security order but also created a new global dynamic." Tschako agreed, pointing out that the war is not just a conflict between two states but a clash of systems. "Russia has been preparing for this conflict for years, and it's not just about Ukraine but about the global balance of power."

Treichl added that the crisis has exposed the weaknesses of the European Union and its member states. "We have been living in a state of complacency, thinking that the EU's security was guaranteed by the United States. But now we are faced with the reality that we need to take responsibility for our own security."

**The Failure of European Defense Policy**

The panelists agreed that the European Union's defense policy has been a failure. "We have been talking about European defense for decades, but we have not taken concrete steps to implement it," said Tschako. "We have been relying on the United States to protect us, but now we are faced with the reality that we need to take responsibility for our own defense."

Treichl pointed out that the EU's defense policy is fragmented and ineffective. "We have 27 member states with different defense strategies and capabilities. We need to develop a common defense policy and increase our military spending."

Gepp added that the crisis has also exposed the lack of trust among EU member states. "We have been talking about a united Europe, but we are still far from achieving it. We need to rebuild trust and work together to address our common challenges."

**The Need for a Stronger European Defense**

The panelists agreed that a stronger European defense is essential for the continent's security. "We need to increase our military spending and develop a common defense strategy," said Tschako. "We also need to strengthen our defense industry and develop new technologies to counter the threats we face."

Treichl added that a stronger European defense is not just about military might but also about diplomacy and economic cooperation. "We need to work together to address our common challenges and promote our common interests. We need to develop a new European security architecture that is based on cooperation and mutual trust."

**The Role of Austria and Switzerland**

Gepp asked the panelists about the role of Austria and Switzerland in the new European security landscape. Tschako pointed out that Austria has a unique position as a neutral country that is not part of NATO but has close ties with the EU. "Austria has a lot of experience in conflict resolution and mediation, and it could play a key role in mediating between different parties."

Treichl added that Switzerland is another country that could play a key role in the new European security landscape. "Switzerland has a long tradition of neutrality and has been a key player in international diplomacy. It could play a key role in promoting dialogue and cooperation between different countries."

**The Future of Europe**

The panelists concluded by discussing the future of Europe. Gepp asked them to imagine a world 20 years from now and to describe what they saw. Tschako envisioned a Europe that is more united and more autonomous, with a strong defense policy and a common foreign policy. "We need to work together to address our common challenges and promote our common interests," she said.

Treichl agreed, but he also warned that the road ahead will be difficult and challenging. "We need to be prepared to make sacrifices and to take risks. We need to work together to build a stronger and more united Europe."

The panel on the shattered global order and the future of Europe was a thought-provoking discussion that highlighted the challenges and opportunities facing the continent. The panelists agreed that a stronger European defense is essential for the continent's security and that Austria and Switzerland could play key roles in promoting dialogue and cooperation between different countries.

**A United Europe: The Future of Security and Defense**

As the world grapples with the complexities of global politics, the need for European unity and cooperation has never been more pressing. At the Vienna Humanities Festival 2022, a panel discussion on "A United Europe: The Future of Security and Defense" brought together experts to share their insights on the current state of European security and defense, and the ways in which the continent can work together to address its challenges.

**The State of European Security and Defense**

The panel was moderated by Stefan Dusche, a renowned expert on European security and defense. The first speaker, emphasized the need for European states to take ownership of their security and defense. "We need to move away from a situation where we're simply following the United States," they said. "We need to develop our own strategy, our own capabilities, and our own institutions."

Another panelist, highlighted the importance of regional cooperation. "We need to focus on regional security and defense, rather than just trying to address global challenges," they said. "We need to work together to address issues like migration, terrorism, and cyber threats."

**The Challenges of European Integration**

The panel also discussed the challenges of European integration. "European integration is a complex process. It requires a deep understanding of the different cultures, languages, and histories of the member states. It's not just about signing treaties and creating institutions; it's about building a sense of community and shared values."

Another panelist, emphasized the need for a more unified European defense policy. "We need to move towards a more integrated defense policy, where we can share resources, expertise, and decision-making," they said. "This will allow us to be more effective in addressing the security challenges we face."

**The Role of the EU in Global Affairs**

The panel also discussed the role of the European Union in global affairs. "The EU is a global player, and we need to recognize that. We need to work with other global powers, like China and the United States, to address the challenges we face."

Another panelist, emphasized the importance of European diplomacy. "Diplomacy is key to resolving conflicts and addressing security challenges," they said. "We need to use our diplomatic skills to build relationships with other countries and to find solutions to our problems."

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the panel discussion at the Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 emphasized the importance of European unity and cooperation in addressing the security and defense challenges of the 21st century. The speakers highlighted the need for a more integrated and effective European defense policy, and the importance of regional cooperation and diplomacy in addressing global challenges.

As the world continues to evolve, it is clear that European unity and cooperation will be crucial in addressing the complex security challenges we face. The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 provided a platform for experts to share their insights and ideas on this critical issue, and we hope that this chapter will inspire further discussion and action on the path towards a more united and secure Europe.


## THOMAS LOHNINGER, NIKOLAUS FORGÓ - Alles Überwacht – Wo bleibt die informationelle Slebsbestimmung

On a sunny afternoon in June 2022, the Vienna Humanities Festival hosted a thought-provoking conversation on the state of data protection in Europe. Thomas Lohninger, a renowned expert in IT law, and Nikolaus Vorgenold, a professor of technology and data protection, engaged in a lively discussion on the current landscape of digital rights and the future of democracy.

**The Status Quo**

Thomas Lohninger began by painting a bleak picture of the current state of data protection in Europe. He lamented the fact that the GDPR, a cornerstone of data protection law, has been largely ineffective in preventing the exploitation of personal data. "We've lost ten years," he said, "and we're still struggling to find a way to make the GDPR work."

Nikolaus Vorgenold nodded in agreement, pointing out that the GDPR's focus on individual rights has been overshadowed by the economic interests of large corporations. "The GDPR was meant to be a game-changer," he said, "but it's become a mere afterthought in the grand scheme of things."

**The Rise of TikTok**

The conversation turned to the rise of social media platforms like TikTok, which have become a breeding ground for data exploitation. Lohninger expressed his concern that TikTok's business model is predicated on the exploitation of user data. "TikTok is a Chinese company that's making a fortune off the backs of European users," he said.

Vorgenold added that the platform's algorithms are designed to maximize engagement, regardless of the consequences for users' privacy. "TikTok's business model is based on the principle of ' algorithmic manipulation,'" he said. "It's a recipe for disaster."

**The Need for Change**

The conversation turned to the need for change, with both speakers emphasizing the importance of taking a proactive approach to data protection. Lohninger called for a fundamental shift in the way we think about data protection, arguing that it's no longer enough to simply react to crises as they arise. "We need to take a step back and rethink the entire framework of data protection," he said.

Vorgenold echoed Lohninger's sentiments, emphasizing the need for a more holistic approach to data protection. "We need to think about data protection as a fundamental right, not just a set of rules and regulations," he said. "We need to put the human being at the center of the discussion."

**The Role of the State**

The conversation turned to the role of the state in protecting data and promoting digital rights. Lohninger argued that the state has a crucial role to play in setting the tone for data protection. "The state has a responsibility to set clear boundaries and enforce them," he said.

Vorgenold agreed, pointing out that the state's failure to do so has led to a power vacuum that has been exploited by corporations. "The state has abdicated its responsibility to regulate the digital sphere," he said. "Now it's up to us to take back control."

**The Future of Democracy**

As the conversation drew to a close, both speakers emphasized the importance of protecting digital rights in order to safeguard democracy. Lohninger argued that the erosion of digital rights is a threat to the very fabric of democracy. "If we don't protect our digital rights, we'll lose our democracy," he said.

Vorgenold echoed Lohninger's sentiments, emphasizing the need for a more inclusive and participatory approach to decision-making. "We need to rethink the way we make decisions in the digital age," he said. "We need to give citizens a seat at the table."

As the audience applauded, it was clear that the conversation had sparked a renewed sense of urgency around the need to protect digital rights and promote democracy. The Vienna Humanities Festival had once again provided a platform for thought-provoking discussion and debate, inspiring attendees to think critically about the role of technology in our lives.

**Reflections on Data Protection and Surveillance**

As the sun set on the Vienna Humanities Festival 2022, the audience was left with a profound sense of unease regarding the state of data protection and surveillance in our modern society. The keynote speaker, a renowned expert in the field, had presented a scathing critique of the current measures in place to protect our personal data, highlighting the numerous vulnerabilities and flaws that leave us exposed to exploitation.

**The Problem of Data Protection**

The speaker began by emphasizing the sheer scale of the problem. "We are drowning in a sea of data," they said, "and yet, we have no idea who has access to it, how it's being used, or what the consequences might be." They highlighted the fact that even seemingly innocuous measures, such as the introduction of biometric passports, can have far-reaching implications for our privacy and security.

The speaker also drew attention to the lack of transparency and accountability in the way data is collected and processed. "We are told that our data is being used to improve our lives, to make our lives easier, but what we don't know is what's happening behind the scenes," they said. "Who is accessing our data? What are they doing with it? And how can we be sure that our data is being protected?"

**The Example of Austria's Number Plate Recognition System**

The speaker used the example of Austria's number plate recognition system to illustrate the problems with data protection. "Austria has implemented a system where number plates are scanned and data is collected on every car that passes through a certain area," they explained. "But what's the purpose of this system? Is it to improve traffic flow, or is it to track people's movements? And what happens to the data once it's been collected?"

The speaker expressed their concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability surrounding the system. "We don't know what's happening to our data, and we don't know who has access to it," they said. "And what's the consequence if our data is compromised? Can we be sure that our personal information is safe?"

**The Role of NGOs in Promoting Data Protection**

The speaker emphasized the importance of NGOs in promoting data protection and challenging the status quo. "NGOs are the watchdogs of society," they said. "We are the ones who hold those in power accountable and who fight for our rights. And it's because of our work that we've been able to expose the flaws in the system and bring attention to the importance of data protection."

The speaker also highlighted the challenges faced by NGOs in promoting data protection. "We're up against powerful forces," they said. "We're up against governments and corporations that have a vested interest in keeping the status quo. But we won't give up. We'll keep fighting for our rights, and we'll keep pushing for transparency and accountability."

**The Need for Education and Innovation**

The speaker concluded by emphasizing the need for education and innovation in promoting data protection. "We need to educate ourselves about the importance of data protection," they said. "We need to understand how our data is being used and how we can protect it. And we need to innovate, to find new ways to keep our data safe and secure."

The speaker also highlighted the importance of international cooperation in promoting data protection. "We're not alone in this fight," they said. "We're part of a global community, and we need to work together to protect our data and our rights."

As the audience dispersed, they were left with a renewed sense of urgency and a sense of hope that change was possible. The speaker's words had struck a chord, and many were inspired to take action and demand better data protection.



## BASIL KERSKI, RUTH WODAK - Krieg, Migration und eine neue Willkommenskultur?

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022, a celebration of interdisciplinary approaches to understanding the human condition, brought together scholars, artists, and thinkers from around the world to engage in thought-provoking discussions on the pressing issues of our time. One of the most compelling events of the festival was a dialogue on migration and borders, featuring Professor Ruth Wodak, a renowned linguist and discourse analyst, and Basil Kerski, a Polish journalist and author. Their conversation was facilitated by Claudia Glagla, a respected journalist and moderator.

As they began their discussion, Ruth Wodak emphasized the importance of understanding the complexities of migration and the need to challenge dominant narratives on the topic. "We are living in a time where the European Union is closing its borders, and we are seeing a massive increase in xenophobia and racism," she said. "It's essential to analyze the discursive processes that shape our understanding of migration and to challenge the dominant narratives that perpetuate fear and exclusion."

Basil Kerski echoed Wodak's sentiments, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of migration and the role of language in shaping our perceptions of it. "Language plays a crucial role in shaping our understanding of migration," he said. "When we use terms like 'refugee crisis' or 'migration wave,' we perpetuate a sense of chaos and disorder. We need to use language that is more precise and respectful, that acknowledges the complexity of the issue."

The conversation then turned to the topic of border control and the impact it has on migrants. Wodak argued that the EU's approach to border control is fundamentally flawed, as it prioritizes security over human rights. "The EU is more concerned with maintaining its borders than with upholding human rights," she said. "This has led to a situation where migrants are being pushed back, turned away, and denied basic rights."

Kerski added that the situation is particularly dire for those seeking asylum. "Asylum seekers are being treated like criminals, not as people who are fleeing war, persecution, or violence," he said. "The EU's approach to asylum is based on a flawed understanding of what it means to be a refugee. We need to recognize the dignity and humanity of these individuals and provide them with the protection and support they need."

The conversation also touched on the role of media in shaping public opinion on migration. Wodak argued that the media plays a significant role in perpetuating negative stereotypes and reinforcing dominant narratives. "The media has a responsibility to report on migration in a fair and balanced manner," she said. "They should not perpetuate stereotypes and stigmatize migrants. Instead, they should focus on telling the stories of migrants and highlighting their experiences and struggles."

Kerski agreed, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced and humanizing approach to reporting on migration. "The media should focus on the human stories behind the statistics," he said. "They should report on the struggles and challenges faced by migrants, rather than perpetuating stereotypes and fear-mongering."

As the conversation drew to a close, Wodak and Kerski emphasized the importance of challenging dominant narratives and promoting a more nuanced understanding of migration. "We need to challenge the dominant narratives and promote a more nuanced understanding of migration," Wodak said. "We need to recognize the complexity of the issue and acknowledge the dignity and humanity of migrants. We need to work towards a more inclusive and welcoming society, where everyone has the right to live with dignity and respect."

Kerski concluded by emphasizing the need for action. "We can no longer afford to remain silent in the face of xenophobia and racism," he said. "We need to take action to challenge these attitudes and promote a more inclusive and welcoming society. We need to recognize the humanity of migrants and provide them with the protection and support they need. The time for action is now."

**The Power of Language in Shaping Our Understanding of Migration**

Ruth Wodak: "I think it's essential to analyze the discursive processes that shape our understanding of migration. We need to challenge the dominant narratives that perpetuate fear and exclusion. Language plays a crucial role in shaping our understanding of migration. When we use terms like 'refugee crisis' or 'migration wave,' we perpetuate a sense of chaos and disorder. We need to use language that is more precise and respectful, that acknowledges the complexity of the issue."

Basil Kerski: "I agree. Language is a powerful tool that can shape our perceptions and attitudes towards migrants. We need to use language that is respectful and dignified, that acknowledges the humanity of migrants. We should avoid using language that is stigmatizing or dehumanizing."

**The EU's Approach to Border Control**

Ruth Wodak: "The EU's approach to border control is fundamentally flawed. It prioritizes security over human rights. This has led to a situation where migrants are being pushed back, turned away, and denied basic rights. We need to recognize the dignity and humanity of migrants and provide them with the protection and support they need."

Basil Kerski: "I agree. The EU's approach to border control is based on a flawed understanding of what it means to be a refugee. We need to recognize the dignity and humanity of asylum seekers and provide them with the protection and support they need. We should not treat them like criminals or second-class citizens."

**The Role of Media in Shaping Public Opinion**

Ruth Wodak: "The media plays a significant role in shaping public opinion on migration. They have a responsibility to report on migration in a fair and balanced manner. They should not perpetuate stereotypes and stigmatize migrants. Instead, they should focus on telling the stories of migrants and highlighting their experiences and struggles."

Basil Kerski: "I agree. The media should focus on the human stories behind the statistics. They should report on the struggles and challenges faced by migrants, rather than perpetuating stereotypes and fear-mongering. We need to humanize migrants and highlight their experiences and struggles."

Ruth Wodak: "We need to challenge the dominant narratives and promote a more nuanced understanding of migration. We need to recognize the complexity of the issue and acknowledge the dignity and humanity of migrants. We need to work towards a more inclusive and welcoming society, where everyone has the right to live with dignity and respect."

Basil Kerski: "We can no longer afford to remain silent in the face of xenophobia and racism. We need to take action to challenge these attitudes and promote a more inclusive and welcoming society. We need to recognize the humanity of migrants and provide them with the protection and support they need. The time for action is now."

**Migration, Integration, and the Future of Europe**

At the 2022 Vienna Humanities Festival, a thought-provoking dialogue took place between Franz Pogatscher, a renowned Austrian intellectual and journalist, and an audience of curious participants. The conversation revolved around the complex topics of migration, integration, and the future of Europe. In this chapter, we will delve into the transcript of the dialogue, exploring the insights and perspectives shared by Pogatscher and the audience.

**The Power of Language**

The conversation began with a discussion on the importance of language in the process of integration. Pogatscher emphasized that language is not just a tool for communication, but also a means to establish a sense of belonging. "When you come to a new country, you have to learn the language, and then you can interact with people," he said. "But even when you learn the language, it's not just about speaking correctly, it's about understanding the culture, the history, and the context."

Pogatscher highlighted the challenges faced by migrants who struggle to learn the language and integrate into their new society. "When you're a migrant, you're often not just a stranger in a new country, but also a stranger in a new language," he noted. "You have to learn the language, but also the culture, the customs, and the values. It's a difficult process, and it's not easy to find the right words to express yourself."

**The Need for Empathy and Understanding**

Throughout the conversation, Pogatscher stressed the importance of empathy and understanding in the integration process. "We need to understand that integration is not just about assimilation, but also about mutual understanding," he said. "We need to understand the culture, the history, and the experiences of the people who come to our country."

Pogatscher also emphasized the need for migrants to be given a platform to share their stories and experiences. "When we listen to the stories of migrants, we can learn so much about their culture, their history, and their struggles," he said. "We need to create a space where people can share their stories, and where we can learn from each other."

**The Role of Education**

The discussion then turned to the role of education in the integration process. Pogatscher emphasized the importance of education in shaping the minds of future generations. "Education is the key to integration," he said. "It's not just about teaching languages, but also about teaching values, such as tolerance, respect, and empathy."

Pogatscher also highlighted the need for education to be inclusive and diverse. "We need to create an education system that is inclusive and diverse, where students can learn about different cultures, histories, and perspectives," he said. "We need to break down the barriers that separate us, and create a common space where we can learn from each other."

**The Future of Europe**

The conversation concluded with a discussion on the future of Europe. Pogatscher emphasized the need for a united and inclusive Europe, where all citizens feel valued and respected. "We need to create a Europe that is based on shared values, such as democracy, human rights, and the rule of law," he said. "We need to create a Europe that is open and inclusive, where all citizens can feel at home."

Pogatscher also highlighted the challenges facing Europe, including the rise of nationalism and xenophobia. "We need to be aware of the dangers of nationalism and xenophobia, and work together to create a more united and inclusive Europe," he said. "We need to remember that we are all Europeans, and that we are all part of the same community."

**Conclusion**

The dialogue with Franz Pogatscher was a powerful reminder of the importance of empathy, understanding, and education in the integration process. His insights and perspectives highlighted the need for a united and inclusive Europe, where all citizens feel valued and respected. As we move forward, it is essential that we continue to engage in these important conversations, and work together to build a brighter future for all Europeans.


## OANA POPESCU-ZAMFIR, THOMAS DE WAAL - Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, How far is the EU willing to go

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a thought-provoking event that brought together esteemed scholars, experts, and thinkers to discuss pressing issues affecting the world. One of the most intriguing panels was "East Eden: A Discussion on European Unity and Enlargement," which explored the complexities of European integration, enlargement, and the challenges faced by countries on the continent.

The panel, moderated by Ivan Vida, featured Tom Deval, a renowned journalist and expert on Eastern Europe, and Anna, a prominent think tank fellow. The discussion revolved around the theme of East Eden, a concept that referred to the idea of a European Eden, where nations could live in harmony and peace.

**The Concept of East Eden**

Tom Deval began by introducing the concept of East Eden, which he described as a utopian vision of a Europe where nations could work together, share values, and promote peace. He emphasized that this idea was not a new concept, as it had been discussed for decades, but it was essential to revisit it in the current context.

Anna added that East Eden was not just a myth, but a reality that could be achieved through the European Union's enlargement process. She highlighted the success stories of countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, which had successfully integrated into the EU and were now reaping the benefits of membership.

**The Challenges of Enlargement**

However, both speakers acknowledged that the enlargement process was not without its challenges. Tom Deval pointed out that the European Union's enlargement fatigue was a significant obstacle, as many member states were struggling to cope with the influx of new members. He warned that this fatigue could lead to a backlash against further enlargement, which would be detrimental to the EU's long-term prospects.

Anna echoed Tom's concerns, emphasizing that the EU needed to address the challenges posed by enlargement, including the need for institutional reform and the harmonization of policies. She stressed that the EU could not continue to expand indefinitely without addressing these issues.

**The Role of the United States**

The panel also touched on the role of the United States in European affairs. Tom Deval noted that the US had been a key player in shaping European politics, particularly during the Cold War era. However, he warned that the US was no longer as engaged in European affairs as it once was, and this was a cause for concern.

Anna added that the US was still an important player in European politics, particularly in the context of the NATO alliance. She emphasized that the US should continue to play a constructive role in promoting European unity and stability.

**The Future of European Integration**

The panel concluded by discussing the future of European integration. Tom Deval emphasized that the EU needed to reinvigorate its enlargement process and focus on deepening integration, rather than just widening it. He warned that the EU could not continue to function as a loose confederation of countries, but needed to become a more cohesive entity.

Anna agreed, stressing that the EU needed to become more effective and efficient in addressing the challenges it faced. She emphasized that the EU should focus on creating a more streamlined and harmonized decision-making process, which would allow it to respond more effectively to the needs of its member states.

In conclusion, the "East Eden" panel at the Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 provided a thought-provoking discussion on the challenges and opportunities facing European integration and enlargement. The speakers emphasized the importance of deepening integration, addressing enlargement fatigue, and promoting a more cohesive and effective EU. As the EU continues to evolve, it is essential that these challenges are addressed and that the concept of East Eden remains a guiding principle for European unity and cooperation.


## KATJA PETROWSKAJA - Wieder Krieg

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a celebration of literature, art, and music that brought together some of the most talented minds from around the world. One of the highlights of the festival was the conversation between Katja Petrowska-Doerfler, a German-Soviet writer, and her interviewer. In this chapter, we will explore their conversation, which delved into the complexities of language, culture, and the human experience.

**The Power of Language**

The conversation began with a discussion about the power of language. Petrowska-Doerfler spoke about how language can be a tool for both connection and disconnection. "For me, language is a way to connect with others, but also to disconnect from myself," she said. "I think that's why I'm so fascinated by the complexities of language, because it's like a double-edged sword - it can bring us together, but also tear us apart."

**The Complexity of Cultural Identity**

The conversation then turned to the topic of cultural identity. Petrowska-Doerfler spoke about how her own cultural identity is complex and multifaceted. "I was born in the Soviet Union, but I grew up in Germany," she said. "I'm a German-Soviet writer, but I don't feel like I fully belong to either culture. I think that's why I'm so interested in exploring the complexities of cultural identity in my work."

**The Impact of War on the Human Experience**

The conversation then shifted to the topic of war and its impact on the human experience. Petrowska-Doerfler spoke about how war can be a powerful catalyst for change, but also a devastating force that can destroy entire communities. "War is a double-edged sword," she said. "It can bring about great change, but it can also bring about great destruction. I think that's why I'm so interested in exploring the complexities of war in my work, because it's a topic that is both fascinating and terrifying."

**The Importance of Empathy**

The conversation then turned to the topic of empathy and its importance in the human experience. Petrowska-Doerfler spoke about how empathy is essential for understanding others, but also for understanding ourselves. "Empathy is like a muscle that needs to be exercised," she said. "It's easy to forget to exercise it, but it's essential for understanding others and understanding ourselves."

**The Power of Storytelling**

The conversation then shifted to the topic of storytelling and its power to bring people together. Petrowska-Doerfler spoke about how storytelling is a universal language that can transcend borders and cultures. "Storytelling is a way to connect with others, to share our experiences and our perspectives," she said. "It's a way to build bridges between cultures and to break down barriers."

**Conclusion**

The conversation between Katja Petrowska-Doerfler and her interviewer was a powerful exploration of the complexities of language, culture, and the human experience. It was a reminder of the importance of empathy, the power of storytelling, and the impact of war on the human experience. The conversation was a testament to the power of literature to bring people together and to inspire change.


## CHRISTOPHER CALDWELL, NATALIYA GUMENYUK SLEEPWALKERS


The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 brought together a diverse group of scholars, writers, and journalists to discuss the complexities of the ongoing Ukrainian crisis. The panel discussion, "The Sleepwalkers' Illusion: The United States, Russia, and the War in Ukraine," featured Christopher Caldwell, contributing editor at the Claremont Review of Books and author of "The Age of Entitlement: America Since the Sixties," and Natalia Gumenyuk, a Ukrainian journalist and founder of the public interest journalism lab, as well as Adam Schatz, the moderator.

The conversation began with Caldwell's assertion that the United States and Russia have been sleepwalking into a conflict in Ukraine. He argued that the West has been too slow to recognize the threat posed by Russian aggression and has been guilty of underestimating the strength of Ukrainian resistance. Gumenyuk agreed, stating that the West has been too focused on its own internal politics and has neglected the growing threat of Russian aggression.

Schatz asked Caldwell to elaborate on his assertion that the United States and Russia are sleepwalking into a conflict. Caldwell responded that both countries have been operating on autopilot, driven by a combination of ideology and inertia. He argued that the United States has been guided by a naive belief in the power of international institutions and the rule of law, while Russia has been driven by a desire to reassert its dominance over Eastern Europe.

Gumenyuk added that the situation is even more complex, with Ukraine caught in the middle of a conflict that is driven by a mix of historical, cultural, and ideological factors. She noted that the Ukrainian people have been fighting for their independence and sovereignty, but have been met with resistance from Russia, which sees Ukraine as a vital part of its own identity and territory.

Schatz asked the panel to consider the implications of the conflict for the United States and its role in the world. Caldwell argued that the United States has a responsibility to support Ukraine and to stand up to Russian aggression, but that this will require a more nuanced and multifaceted approach. He suggested that the United States should focus on building a coalition of like-minded countries and should be willing to use military force if necessary to defend Ukraine.

Gumenyuk agreed, emphasizing the importance of international support for Ukraine and the need for the West to recognize the gravity of the situation. She noted that the conflict is not just about Ukraine, but about the future of European security and the stability of the global order.

The panel also touched on the issue of sanctions, with Caldwell arguing that the West has been too slow to impose meaningful sanctions on Russia. Gumenyuk agreed, noting that sanctions can be an effective tool for exerting pressure on Russia, but that they should be used in conjunction with other forms of diplomacy and economic pressure.

The conversation concluded with a discussion of the role of ideology in the conflict. Caldwell argued that the conflict is driven by a clash of ideologies, with Russia seeking to reassert its dominance over Eastern Europe and Ukraine fighting for its independence and sovereignty. Gumenyuk agreed, emphasizing the importance of understanding the historical and cultural context of the conflict.

The panel discussion was followed by a Q&A session, during which the audience asked questions about the implications of the conflict for the United States and its role in the world. The discussion highlighted the complexity and nuance of the situation, and the need for a multifaceted approach to resolving the conflict.


## CATHERINE BELTON - Putin's Roads in KGB and the road to war in Ukraine _ Wiener Vorlesungen


The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a platform for some of the most thought-provoking conversations of our time. Among the many remarkable events that took place, one conversation stood out for its candor and insight: a talk between Catherine Belton, award-winning journalist and author, and a select audience at the historic Palais Schwarzenberg. In this chapter, we present the transcript of that conversation, which offers a rare glimpse into the workings of power and the machinations of those who wield it.

**Catherine Belton**: I'm Catherine Belton, and I'm here today to discuss my book, "Putin's People: How the KGB Took Back Russia and Then Took On the West." It's a story about the rise of Vladimir Putin and the ways in which the KGB continues to shape Russian politics and policy.

**Moderator**: Catherine, your book has sparked a lot of controversy. How do you respond to critics who say that your portrayal of Putin and the KGB is too simplistic, too conspiracy-theory-driven?

**Catherine Belton**: I think those critics are missing the point. My book is not about conspiracy theories; it's about the facts. It's about the ways in which the KGB has infiltrated every level of Russian society, from politics to business to culture. And it's about how Putin has used that network to consolidate his power and shape Russian policy.

**Audience Member 1**: But don't you think that's a bit... alarmist? I mean, isn't the KGB just a relic of the past?

**Catherine Belton**: I think that's a dangerous misconception. The KGB may have changed its name, but its methods and goals remain the same. And Putin's rise to power was facilitated by the KGB's network, which he used to build his own power base. That's why I call them "Putin's people."

**Moderator**: That's a fascinating point. Can you tell us more about how Putin's relationship with the KGB has shaped his approach to power?

**Catherine Belton**: Well, Putin's time in the KGB taught him the importance of loyalty and discipline. He learned how to use fear and intimidation to control people, and how to build a network of loyal allies. And when he came to power, he brought those skills with him. He used the KGB to eliminate his enemies, to silence dissenting voices, and to build a system of patronage and corruption.

**Audience Member 2**: But what about the West? How did we get so caught up in this game?

**Catherine Belton**: Ah, that's a great question. I think we in the West got caught up in the idea that Russia was a normal country, that it was just like any other country. We didn't realize that the KGB was still in control, and that Putin was still using those same tactics to manipulate us. And we certainly didn't realize that our own politicians and businessmen were being played by the KGB.

**Moderator**: That's a sobering thought. Do you think there's a way to break this cycle of manipulation and...


## PHILIPP BLOM - Macht euch die Erde untertan - Aufstieg und Fall einer Idee

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a remarkable event that brought together scholars, thinkers, and enthusiasts from around the world to explore the complexities of human existence. One of the highlights of the festival was the keynote address delivered by Philipp Blom, a renowned historian and philosopher. In this chapter, we will delve into the transcript of his thought-provoking speech, which tackled the themes of climate change, colonialism, and the human condition.

**The Power of History**

Blom began his address by highlighting the importance of history in understanding the present. He emphasized that our understanding of the world is shaped by the stories we tell about the past, and that these stories have the power to shape our perceptions and actions. He noted that the current crisis of climate change is not a sudden event, but rather the culmination of a long history of human activity that has ravaged the planet.

> Wir haben immer eine Geschichte, die uns erklärt, wie wir leben. Wir haben immer eine Geschichte, die uns erklärt, warum wir so sind, was wir tun und was wir nicht tun. Und diese Geschichte ist immer politisch.

(We always have a story that explains how we live. We always have a story that explains who we are, what we do, and what we don't do. And this story is always political.)

**The Era of European Dominance**

Blom then turned his attention to the era of European dominance, which he characterized as a time of brutal colonialism and exploitation. He noted that the idea of European superiority was built on the notion that Europeans were the "chosen people" of God, and that this idea was used to justify the exploitation and enslavement of non-European populations.

> Die europäische Herrschaft war eine Herrschaft der Gewalt, der Ausbeutung und der Vernichtung. Sie war eine Herrschaft, die auf dem Glauben basierte, dass die Europäer die auserwählten Menschen Gottes waren.

(European dominance was a reign of violence, exploitation, and destruction. It was a reign that was based on the belief that Europeans were the chosen people of God.)

**The Impact of Climate Change**

Blom then shifted his focus to the impact of climate change, which he characterized as a global crisis that is the result of human activity. He noted that the burning of fossil fuels has led to a rapid increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, which is causing the planet to warm at an unprecedented rate.

> Wir sind die Bedrohung. Wir sind diejenigen, die die Erde bedrohen. Wir sind diejenigen, die die Natur bedrohen.

(We are the threat. We are those who threaten the Earth. We are those who threaten nature.)

**The Need for a New Story**

Blom concluded his address by emphasizing the need for a new story about humanity's place in the world. He argued that the old story of European dominance is no longer relevant, and that a new narrative is needed that acknowledges the interconnectedness of all living beings and the need for collective action to address the climate crisis.

> Wir brauchen eine neue Geschichte. Wir brauchen eine Geschichte, die uns erklärt, warum wir so sind und was wir tun können, um die Erde zu retten.

(We need a new story. We need a story that explains why we are what we are and what we can do to save the Earth.)


**The Unsettling Truths of Our Times**

The philosopher began by highlighting the rapid pace of technological advancements and the subsequent impact on our relationship with nature. "We are living in a time where we are constantly trying to optimize our lives, to make them more efficient, more productive. But what we forget is that nature is not a machine that can be optimized. It is a living, breathing entity that requires our respect and care."

He went on to discuss the concept of "cognitive dissonance," where our actions and beliefs are at odds with the reality of the world around us. "We are constantly trying to reconcile the contradictions between our words and actions. But what if we are not just reconciling, but also perpetuating the very problems we claim to be solving?"

The philosopher also touched upon the topic of the "underlying dynamics" of human society, where social and economic forces shape our perceptions and actions. "We are living in a society that is driven by growth, by progress. But what if this growth is not sustainable? What if it is actually destroying the very fabric of our existence?"

He also spoke about the importance of recognizing the "alternatives" that have been suppressed throughout history. "We often focus on the dominant narratives, the ones that have shaped our understanding of the world. But what about the voices that have been silenced, the perspectives that have been marginalized? What about the alternative ways of thinking that have been lost to the annals of time?"

The philosopher's words were met with nods of agreement and thoughtful murmurs from the audience. It was clear that he had struck a chord, highlighting the complexities and contradictions that we often try to ignore.

**The Paradox of Human Progress**

The philosopher went on to discuss the concept of "progress" and how it has been used to justify the exploitation of nature and the oppression of certain groups. "We often talk about progress as if it is a linear concept, a straightforward path from A to B. But what if progress is actually a circular concept, where we are perpetuating the same patterns of behavior that have led to our current predicament?"

He also touched upon the idea of "technological determinism," where we believe that technology is the sole driver of change. "We are so convinced that technology will solve our problems, that it will make our lives easier. But what if technology is just a tool, a means to an end? What if the end is not just about efficiency, but about justice, about equality, about sustainability?"

The philosopher's words left the audience with much to think about. It was clear that he had challenged the dominant narratives and forced us to question our assumptions about the world.

**The Power of Alternatives**

The philosopher ended his talk by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the alternatives that have been suppressed throughout history. "We often focus on the dominant narratives, the ones that have shaped our understanding of the world. But what about the voices that have been silenced, the perspectives that have been marginalized? What about the alternative ways of thinking that have been lost to the annals of time?"

He also spoke about the need to re-examine our relationship with nature and to recognize the "cognitive dissonance" that exists between our actions and beliefs. "We are constantly trying to reconcile the contradictions between our words and actions. But what if we are not just reconciling, but also perpetuating the very problems we claim to be solving?"

The philosopher's words were met with applause and thoughtful nods from the audience. It was clear that he had left a lasting impression, challenging us to think critically about the world around us and our place within it.

**Conclusion**

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 was a thought-provoking event that brought together some of the most renowned minds in the world to discuss the pressing issues of our time. The philosopher's talk was a powerful reminder of the complexities and contradictions that we often try to ignore. His words challenged us to question our assumptions about the world and to recognize the alternatives that have been suppressed throughout history. As we move forward, it is essential that we continue to engage with these ideas and to challenge the dominant narratives that shape our understanding of the world.



## YURI SLEZKINE - The overthrow of literary Canons and the Decline of Western Civilization

### A Conversation on Western Civilization and its Decline

The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 brought together scholars, thinkers, and enthusiasts from around the world to discuss some of the most pressing issues of our time. One of the most thought-provoking conversations was between a renowned historian and a moderator, exploring the concept of Western civilization and its decline.

**The Conversation**

Moderator: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we're joined by a distinguished historian to discuss the rise and decline of Western civilization. Our guest has written extensively on the subject and has a unique perspective on the matter. Before we begin, I'd like to ask, what is your take on the current state of Western civilization?

Historian: Thank you for having me. I think Western civilization is in a state of crisis. The concept of Western civilization is often associated with liberal democracy, capitalism, and Christianity, but these values are no longer universally accepted. The rise of nationalism, authoritarianism, and postmodernism has led to a decline in the relevance and influence of Western civilization.

Moderator: That's a fascinating perspective. Can you elaborate on what you mean by the decline of Western civilization?

Historian: Well, one of the main reasons is the loss of faith in the universal values that were once associated with Western civilization. The Enlightenment values of reason, individualism, and human rights are no longer widely accepted. Instead, we see a resurgence of tribalism, nationalism, and identity politics. This has led to a fragmentation of society and a decline in the sense of shared humanity.

Moderator: That's a compelling argument. But isn't the concept of Western civilization itself problematic? Some argue that it's a Eurocentric construct that ignores the contributions of other cultures.

Historian: Ah, yes, that's a valid criticism. Western civilization is indeed a Eurocentric construct, and it's true that it has been criticized for its exclusivity and arrogance. However, I believe that it's possible to reframe Western civilization in a more inclusive and nuanced way. We can acknowledge the contributions of other cultures while still recognizing the unique achievements of Western civilization.

Moderator: That's a thought-provoking perspective. Can you tell us more about what you mean by redefining Western civilization?

Historian: One way to redefine Western civilization is to recognize the influence of non-Western cultures on Western society. For example, the concept of the individual was influenced by ancient Greek philosophy, while the concept of human rights was influenced by Christianity. By recognizing these influences, we can create a more inclusive and diverse understanding of Western civilization.

Moderator: That's a great point. Another criticism of Western civilization is that it's often associated with colonialism, imperialism, and oppression. How do you respond to these charges?

Historian: Well, it's true that Western civilization has been associated with colonialism and imperialism, and these are certainly negative aspects of its history. However, it's also important to recognize that Western civilization has been a force for good in many parts of the world. For example, the spread of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law have all been influenced by Western civilization.

Moderator: That's a nuanced perspective. Finally, what do you think is the future of Western civilization?

Historian: Well, I'm not sure what the future holds, but I think it's possible for Western civilization to reinvent itself and adapt to the changing world. We need to recognize the diversity of human cultures and values and find ways to incorporate them into our understanding of Western civilization. We also need to acknowledge the flaws and mistakes of Western civilization and work towards a more inclusive and just society.

**Conclusion**

The conversation between the historian and the moderator highlighted the complexities and nuances of Western civilization and its decline. While it's clear that Western civilization is in a state of crisis, it's also possible to redefine it in a more inclusive and diverse way. By recognizing the contributions of other cultures and acknowledging the flaws and mistakes of Western civilization, we can create a more just and equitable society. The Vienna Humanities Festival 2022 provided a platform for scholars and thinkers to explore these important questions and challenge our assumptions about Western civilization.

# OpenShift Serverless: Using Knative in next-generation AI applications | DevNation Tech Talk

In a groundbreaking DevNation Tech Talk, Ian Lawson, a fervent advocate for developers and a seasoned expert in AI and UX, delves into the innovative integration of Knative into next-generation AI applications. This exploration heralds a new era in artificial intelligence, where the dynamic capabilities of Knative are leveraged to create adaptive, event-driven AI systems. The discussion provides a fascinating glimpse into a future where AI can adapt and evolve in real-time, driven by the sophisticated orchestration of serverless functions.

## The Vision: Adaptive Artificial Intelligence

The crux of Lawson's presentation lies in the transformative approach to coding neurons within AI systems. Traditionally, neurons in artificial neural networks are static, with predetermined functions that process inputs and generate outputs based on set thresholds. Lawson proposes a revolutionary shift towards dynamic, adaptive neurons. These neurons would not be limited by hardcoded functionality; instead, they would operate based on adaptable code defined in YAML. This adaptability allows the behavior of neurons to evolve in response to interactions within the network, paving the way for AI that can modify its processing logic in real-time.

## Knative: The Framework for Evolution

Knative emerges as the backbone of this ambitious vision. It offers a robust platform for deploying and managing serverless, event-driven architectures that can scale on-demand. In the context of AI, Knative facilitates the creation of a neural network where each neuron is a serverless function that can be triggered by specific events. This setup enables the implementation of complex, adaptive behaviors within the AI system, with neurons capable of rewriting their logic based on the data they process and the interactions they have with other neurons.

## A Practical Demonstration

The tech talk showcases a practical demonstration of this concept, employing a simplified model to illustrate how adaptive AI might function. Lawson introduces a scenario with three key components: a neuron forwarder, a neuron responder, and a neuron reader. Each component is designed to process events in a specific manner, demonstrating the basic principles of an adaptive AI system. This model, though elementary, underscores the potential for creating more sophisticated AI systems using Knative and adaptive coding techniques.

## Beyond AI: Building Complex Systems

The discussion extends beyond the realm of artificial intelligence, touching upon the broader implications for building complex systems. The principles of event-driven architecture and serverless computing are highlighted as critical components in designing scalable, efficient, and adaptable systems. These concepts are not only pivotal for the next generation of AI but also for the development of complex applications that can benefit from the modular, flexible approach championed by Knative.

## The Future of AI and Knative

As the talk concludes, Lawson emphasizes the untapped potential of integrating Knative with artificial intelligence. The adaptability and scalability offered by Knative could revolutionize how AI systems are developed, allowing for unprecedented levels of complexity and adaptability. Moreover, the discussion hints at the broader applications of these technologies in optimizing infrastructure for sustainability and enhancing the capabilities of machine learning models to refine autoscaling decisions.

## Conclusion

Ian Lawson's DevNation Tech Talk is a compelling narrative of innovation, offering a peek into the future of artificial intelligence powered by Knative. It challenges traditional notions of AI development and proposes a novel approach where adaptability and evolution are at the core of intelligent systems. As we stand on the cusp of this new frontier, the possibilities for AI and technology as a whole seem boundless, promising a future where artificial intelligence is not just a tool but a dynamic, evolving partner in solving complex challenges.

For those intrigued by the potential of adaptive AI and the role of Knative in shaping the future of technology, exploring Lawson's work and the concepts introduced in this tech talk is a step towards understanding the next wave of innovation in artificial intelligence.

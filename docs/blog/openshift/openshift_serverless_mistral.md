# OpenShift Serverless: Using Knative in Next-Generation AI Applications

In this Tech Talk session, Marcus and Kevin discuss the use of OpenShift serverless technology with Knative for building next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) applications. In this blog post, we will summarize the key points from their conversation.

## Overcoming Fear of AI

Marcus started by sharing his perspective on AI, acknowledging that it is a topic that instills fear in many people due to its potential impact on employment. However, he also emphasized that the real AI behind all the buzz is still not here and that there is a lot of potential for innovation in this field.

## The Basics of Neural Networks and AI

Marcus then shared some history of neural networks and AI, explaining that they are based on modeling the process of the human brain to make decisions. He also talked about how AI has evolved from rule-based systems to more sophisticated approaches like deep learning and machine learning.

## Using Knative in Serverless AI Applications

Knative is a set of tools for building, deploying, and managing modern applications on Kubernetes. Marcus explained that it can be used to build serverless AI applications by handling events, scaling components, and connecting services together efficiently. He also mentioned the use of CloudEvents, which provide a common format for transmitting data between different systems.

## Adaptive Artificial Intelligence with OpenShift

Marcus discussed how OpenShift can be used to build adaptive AI applications using event-driven architecture. He explained that this approach allows components to react to events in real-time, making the system more flexible and responsive. Marcus also talked about the use of K native's event-driven components, such as neuron forwarder, neuron responder, and neuron reader, which can be used to build adaptive behaviors.

## Building Complex AI Systems with Simple Components

Marcus emphasized that building complex AI systems does not have to involve writing a lot of boilerplate code. Instead, it is possible to use simple components that handle specific tasks and combine them to create more sophisticated systems. He also mentioned the use of tools like Camel K, which can be used to build step-based event forwarders and processors.

## The Future of AI with OpenShift

Marcus concluded the session by discussing some potential future applications of AI with OpenShift. He mentioned the possibility of using machine learning models to optimize infrastructure and create more sustainable systems. He also emphasized that there is still a lot of potential for innovation in the field, as AI continues to evolve and become more sophisticated.

In summary, the session provided an overview of how OpenShift and Knative can be used to build next-generation AI applications. Marcus discussed the importance of understanding the basics of neural networks and AI, as well as the benefits of using event-driven architecture and simple components to build complex systems. He also emphasized that there is still a lot of potential for innovation in this field and encouraged developers to explore new possibilities with OpenShift.

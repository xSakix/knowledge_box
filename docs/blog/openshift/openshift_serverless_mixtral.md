OpenShift Serverless: Using Knative in Next-Generation AI Applications
=====================================================================

In this talk, Marcus and Kevin discuss the use of OpenShift Serverless and Knative for building next-generation AI applications. They cover a range of topics related to artificial intelligence, including the overuse of the term "AI", neural networks, large language models, and more. In addition to these technical discussions, they also share their personal experiences with development and artificial intelligence.

The Overuse of the Term "AI"
-----------------------------

One of the main points that Marcus and Kevin discuss is the overuse and misuse of the term "AI". They note that many things are labeled as AI that do not actually meet the definition of artificial intelligence, which can be confusing for developers and others who are trying to understand the technology. They encourage viewers to be more precise in their use of the term, and to avoid using it as a catch-all label for any kind of automated system.

Neural Networks and Large Language Models
------------------------------------------

Marcus and Kevin also discuss the role of neural networks and large language models in AI development. They explain that these technologies are based on the idea of replicating the process of human thought, using algorithms to create inferences from data. They note that while these models can be powerful, they are not true artificial intelligence, as they do not have the ability to understand or reason about the world in the same way that humans do.

One example of a large language model is chatGPT, which is designed to answer questions from users. Marcus and Kevin discuss how this model works, and how it can be used to build AI applications. They note that while chatGPT can generate responses to user queries, it does not have the ability to understand or reason about the world in the same way that a human would.

Adaptive Artificial Intelligence
---------------------------------

Another topic that Marcus and Kevin discuss is adaptive artificial intelligence. This is a type of AI that is able to learn and evolve over time, using data from its environment to improve its performance. They note that this kind of AI can be very powerful, as it is able to continually learn and adapt to new situations.

One example of an adaptive AI system is the engram technology, which is designed to identify plagiarism in text. Marcus and Kevin explain how this technology works, using a token-based approach to analyze the positioning of words in a text. They note that this approach can be very effective at detecting plagiarism, as it is able to identify subtle patterns in the way that words are used.

OpenShift Serverless and Knative
--------------------------------

Finally, Marcus and Kevin discuss the use of OpenShift Serverless and Knative for building AI applications. They explain that these tools provide a powerful platform for developing serverless applications, allowing developers to build and deploy code in a highly scalable and efficient way. They note that this can be particularly useful for AI applications, which often require a lot of computational power and the ability to scale quickly in response to changes in demand.

Conclusion
----------

Overall, this talk provides a wide-ranging discussion of artificial intelligence and its role in software development. Marcus and Kevin share their experiences and insights on topics such as the overuse of the term "AI", neural networks, large language models, and adaptive AI. They also discuss the use of OpenShift Serverless and Knative for building serverless applications, highlighting the benefits that these tools can provide for AI development.

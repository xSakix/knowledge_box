OpenShift Serverless and Knative: The Future of AI Applications
=============================================================

Introduction
------------

The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been rapidly evolving, with many advancements being made in recent years. In this transcript from a DevNation Tech Talk, Marcus Kesseler discusses the use of OpenShift Serverless and Knative in next-generation AI applications. He also touches on the misconceptions surrounding AI and the importance of properly understanding and defining what we mean when we talk about AI.

Misconceptions about AI
------------------------

There is a lot of fear and misunderstanding surrounding AI, with many people worried about losing their jobs to automated systems. However, Kesseler points out that much of what is being labeled as AI today is not true AI, but rather sophisticated algorithms and data processing techniques. He also mentions the concept of artificial unintelligence, which refers to the misuse and overuse of the term AI to describe any kind of programming or algorithm.

True AI, on the other hand, involves the ability to make inferences and create new information based on existing information without following a set rule. This is in contrast to narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks and does not have the ability to generalize or learn from new information.

Neural Networks and Inference
------------------------------

At the heart of true AI are neural networks, which are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that process and transmit information. These networks can be trained to recognize patterns and make predictions based on large datasets.

One key aspect of neural networks is inference, which refers to the ability to create new information based on existing information without following a set rule. This is what sets true AI apart from narrow or weak AI, which relies on predefined rules and algorithms.

Large Language Models
---------------------

Large language models, such as chatGPT, are a type of AI that can understand and generate human-like text based on a given prompt. These models are trained on massive datasets and use deep learning techniques to understand the nuances and complexities of language. However, Kesseler points out that these models are not truly intelligent in the sense that they do not have the ability to make inferences or create new information. Instead, they generate text based on patterns and probabilities learned from the training data.

The Importance of Properly Defining AI
-------------------------------------

As the field of AI continues to evolve, it is important to properly define what we mean when we talk about AI. Misusing the term can lead to misunderstandings and unrealistic expectations about what AI is capable of. By clearly defining AI as a system that can make inferences and create new information based on existing information without following a set rule, we can better understand the limitations and potential of this technology.

OpenShift Serverless and Knative
---------------------------------

One platform that has the potential to support true AI applications is OpenShift Serverless, which uses Knative to provide a serverless computing environment. This allows developers to build and deploy event-driven applications that can automatically scale up or down based on demand.

Knative provides a set of components for building, deploying, and managing serverless workloads on Kubernetes. It includes features such as automatic scaling, routing, and monitoring, making it an ideal platform for building AI applications that require real-time processing and analysis of large datasets.

Conclusion
----------

The field of AI is rapidly evolving, with many advancements being made in recent years. However, it is important to properly define what we mean when we talk about AI and to understand the limitations and potential of this technology. OpenShift Serverless and Knative provide a powerful platform for building event-driven applications that can support true AI workloads, but it is up to developers and researchers to push the boundaries of what is possible with this technology.

In summary, here are the key points from the transcript:

* There is a lot of fear and misunderstanding surrounding AI, with many people worried about losing their jobs to automated systems.
* True AI involves the ability to make inferences and create new information based on existing information without following a set rule.
* Neural networks are at the heart of true AI, with interconnected nodes or artificial neurons that process and transmit information.
* Large language models, such as chatGPT, can understand and generate human-like text based on a given prompt but do not have the ability to make inferences or create new information.
* Properly defining AI is important for understanding its limitations and potential.
* OpenShift Serverless and Knative provide a powerful platform for building event-driven applications that can support true AI workloads.

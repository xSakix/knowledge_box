## Open-Source Exploitation - David Whitney - NDC London 2024

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YQgNDLFYq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YQgNDLFYq8)

 - Open source software is in precarious position due to exploitation by large organizations.
- Original intention of open source was to share source code freely, allowing users to modify and improve software.
- Exploitation occurs when large organizations use open source software without giving back to the community or contributing to its sustainability.
- Permissive licenses allow individual organizations to take open source work, build upon it, and profit without contributing back to the community.
- Open source software adoption in enterprise is driven by permissive licenses and corporate strategy, rather than the original principles of sharing and collaboration.
- Large organizations can leverage open source software power, while small individual creators struggle to make a living from their work.
- The balance of power in open source has shifted towards large tech corporations like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, who can exploit open source software without contributing back.
- The open source community has evolved into a commercial ecosystem, where many successful projects are backed by large corporations with significant marketing and strategic positioning advantages.
- The open source movement needs to re-examine its ethos, prioritizing freedom and collaboration over exploitation for profit.
- There is a need to readdress the imbalance between large organizations and individual creators, focusing on the sustainability of the open source ecosystem.
- Open source software should be supported by the community, not exploited for profit by large corporations.
- The open source movement needs to foster a culture of collaboration, where large corporations contribute back to the community instead of taking without giving.
- Alternative funding models, such as patreon and crowdfunding, are emerging as potential solutions to support creators and sustain the open source ecosystem.
- The open source movement should focus on quality service, fair compensation, and supporting individual creators, rather than exploiting their work for profit.

## You Keep Using That Word: Asynchronous And Interprocess Comms - Sam Newman - NDC London 2024

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-MOtcat1iE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-MOtcat1iE)

 Summary:

- Sam Newman's talk at NDC London 2024 focused on the terms synchronous and asynchronous and how they are used in communication and software design.
- The talk discussed the difference between synchronous communication (immediate request-response interaction) and asynchronous communication (non-blocking, event-driven interaction).
- Newman emphasized that the distinction between the two is not as clear as people often think, and that there is no consensus on a clear definition.
- Newman discussed various terms, like "event-driven," "non-blocking," and "eventual consistency," which can be confusing.
- He shared his journey of understanding these terms and the evolution of his thoughts on the subject over time.
- Newman pointed out the limitations of the terms "asynchronous" and "synchronous" and suggested that using them less might be helpful.
- He recommended focusing on the context and goals of the communication rather than the terminology.
- The talk touched on various examples, including message brokers, intermediaries, and database systems.
- Newman suggested that asynchronous communication is often associated with stateless processing and can encourage better system design.
- The talk concluded with the idea that focusing on the context and goals of communication, rather than getting caught up in terminology, can lead to better system design and understanding.

 - Hacking works by understanding systems, finding vulnerabilities, and exploiting them.
- The speaker has a diverse background including professional musician, software developer, and working in various tech industries.
- The speaker has experience in jailbreaking and working with new technology, such as AIS.
- Hacking can be used for both good and bad purposes, with ethical hackers (white hat hackers) often working to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- Web hacking involves understanding web applications, web protocols, and web server configurations.
- CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions are a way to learn hacking techniques and think differently about systems.
- Web exploits can range from simple SQL injection attacks to more complex vulnerabilities in web applications.
- Regular expressions and other programming techniques can be used to analyze and exploit vulnerabilities.
- Web applications can be tested using tools such as whatweb, which checks response headers and other web-related information.
- Insecure deserialization methods, such as using Node.js, can be exploited by attackers.
- CTF competitions can be fun and educational, teaching teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills.
- Hacker conferences, such as NDC London, can provide opportunities to learn from and connect with other hackers and security professionals.
- Boot camps and workshops can teach basic hacking concepts and techniques.
- Twitch streams and online communities can also provide a platform for learning and discussing hacking topics.

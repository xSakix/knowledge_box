URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndJP-vmZFYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndJP-vmZFYk)

 * Ivan Mikushin from VMware discussing WebAssembly Garbage Collector (Wasm GC)
* Wasm GC needed due to popularity of languages requiring garbage collection like JavaScript, Java, Python, Go, etc.
* Wasm GC proposal adds Heap type with subtypes and recursive types, index type, new instructions, and shorthand notations.
* Heap memory is used for garbage collection and managed data in WebAssembly.
* Three disjoint hierarchies in WebAssembly: functional type, external type, and aggregate type.
* 30 new instructions added to support garbage collection.
* Compilers supporting WebAssembly garbage collection are coming soon for popular languages.
* WebAssembly runtime controls memory management using Heap.
* Garbage collector ensures that unreferenced data is automatically freed.
* WebAssembly uses a 32-bit integer, and i31 refers to an unboxed scalar type.
* Rust uses automatic memory management with borrow checker instead of garbage collection.
* Different languages have different memory models, and some require garbage collection.
* Compiler knows exactly where memory is allocated in WebAssembly, unlike Rust.
* Chrome V8 engine has already implemented Wasm GC support, and other projects are working on it.
* Kotlin is expected to get Wasm GC support soon.

## Wasm Components for Every Language - Kyle Brown, SingleStore

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqehHuPYUSc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqehHuPYUSc)

 * Kyle Brown from SingleStore discusses making Wasm components for every language
* Two main points: making a component for every language and making different languages work together
* Components are structured as modules with import/export abstractions
* Components contain a module and can be instantiated like links
* Component model is layered on top of core WebAssembly, allowing the expression of complicated semantics
* To create a component, one writes code at the component level, which is then lowered to core WebAssembly
* Interface type modules are used for linking components together
* The Wasm toolchain can parse and call the binary component directly
* Creating business logic in assembly language directly is time-consuming and not practical for most use cases
* Runtime wrapping is an alternative approach, where the tool generates bindings to adapt types between languages
* Precompiled runtimes like SpiderMonkey are used for JavaScript components
* Snapshotting improves startup speed by preinitializing component state
* The binding generation process can generate errors if type mismatches occur
* Components can be composed by importing and instantiating them together, creating a graph of components
* Lifting and lowering are needed to convert data between components with different representations
* Tower Wansum is a tool that allows for component drag-and-drop composition using open source tools.

<p>In this transcript, Sam Newman discusses asynchronous and interprocess communication in the context of software architecture and microservices. Key points include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous communication refers to the exchange of messages where sender and receiver are not in direct communication.</li>
<li>Asynchronous communication is often seen as a better alternative to synchronous communication, as it allows for better handling of latency and the ability to continue processing without waiting for a response.</li>
<li>Asynchronous communication can be implemented using various techniques such as message brokers, event-driven architectures, and reactive systems.</li>
<li>The term "asynchronous" can have different meanings for different people, often depending on their background and experience.</li>
<li>Asynchronous communication can help reduce the complexity of distributed systems by decoupling components and allowing them to work independently.</li>
<li>The concept of temporal decoupling refers to the idea of separating the time at which sender and receiver communicate.</li>
<li>Using the term "asynchronous" might not always be helpful, as it can lead to confusion and misinterpretation.</li>
<li>The concept of asynchronous communication is closely related to the Reactive Manifesto, which emphasizes the importance of designing systems that are responsive, resilient, elastic, and message-driven.</li>

<li>Amy Kapernick, front-end developer from Perth, Australia, gave a talk at NDC London 2023 about building a QuokkaBot using different technologies and APIs.</li>
<li>The QuokkaBot was initially built as a WhatsApp bot, using the Twilio Communications API for sending a picture of a quokka to the user.</li>
<li>The bot was later improved with an image recognition feature using Azure Cognitive Services' Custom Vision API.</li>
<li>The bot has evolved into a multi-functional tool, integrating WhatsApp, email (using SendGrid), and Twitter communication methods.</li>
<li>Custom Vision API has been used for training a model to recognize quokkas and other animals in images.</li>
<li>The bot has a database of 545 photos of quokkas and 286 photos of Quakers (non-quokkas) for training.</li>
<li>The bot can send images of quokkas or other animals based on the user's input.</li>
<li>The bot can also identify if an image is a quokka, with an accuracy of around 99%.</li>
<li>The bot's source code is available on GitHub, and Amy encourages people to contribute and improve the project.</li>
<li>Amy mentioned the challenges of building the bot, such as the heavily biased training dataset, and how the bot can sometimes be tricked by user inputs.</li>

<p>In this talk, Nicolas Fränkel discussed various aspects of backend for frontend development, focusing on microservices and their impact on organizational structures. Here are the key points from the transcript:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicolas Fränkel has been a developer for two decades, working primarily with Java and Spring. He's also an advocate for Kotlin and Flask applications.</li>
<li>Fränkel believes that microservices are often over-hyped, and that the industry has not yet solved the problem of how to manage and organize them effectively.</li>
<li>He sees microservices as a symptom of organizational problems, such as the tendency for organizations to focus on short-term goals rather than long-term sustainability.</li>
<li>Fränkel suggests that developers should focus on creating modular, reusable components and using APIs to facilitate communication between them.</li>
<li>He also recommends using API gateways to handle routing, authentication, and other cross-cutting concerns, which can simplify the architecture and reduce the complexity of the backend.</li>
<li>Fränkel believes that developers should be aware of the limitations and trade-offs of their chosen technologies, and should strive to create solutions that are maintainable and adaptable to changing requirements.</li>
<li>The talk also touched on the importance of collaboration between frontend and backend developers, and the role of tools like GraphQL in facilitating communication between different teams within an organization.</li>
<li>Fränkel emphasized the need for a balanced approach to problem-solving, taking into account both technical and organizational aspects, and the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in the rapidly-changing technology landscape.</li>

<p>In his talk at NDC London, William Brander discussed the top five techniques to build the worst microservice system ever. These techniques aimed at intentionally making the system as bad as possible:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Creating a Monolith</strong>: Brander suggested starting with a monolithic system and slowly transitioning to microservices using a Strangler Fig pattern. This technique is based on incrementally isolating functionality and moving it to separate services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Introducing Network Hops</strong>: Introducing network hops and distributed systems would likely increase latency and complexity, as communication between services can become expensive and time-consuming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</strong>: Brander criticized SOA as a way to make systems worse, since it often leads to increased coupling and communication overhead between services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distributed Monitoring</strong>: Brander argued that distributed monitoring systems could potentially make the overall throughput of the system worse. In a distributed system, network operations and resource contention could lead to performance degradation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Boundary Definition</strong>: Defining service boundaries based on nouns rather than verbs, and ensuring maximum chance for cross-service communication can lead to a more interconnected system, which may be harder to maintain and manage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, Brander's talk highlighted the challenges and pitfalls of building distributed microservice systems, and the potential for these systems to become complex, hard to maintain, and perform poorly if not designed carefully.</p>

<ul>
<li>The speakers discuss the process of domain-driven design (DDD), software architecture, and using event storming and bounded context canvas as tools to identify and refine domain boundaries.</li>
<li>Event storming helps visualize the flow of events in a system and is useful for identifying potential domain boundaries.</li>
<li>Bounded context canvas is a tool for representing the boundaries and interactions between different domains within a system.</li>
<li>DDD helps align software with business requirements, reduce coupling between different domains, and improve team communication and collaboration.</li>
<li>When refining domain boundaries, it's important to consider the strength of coupling and cohesion, as well as the potential impact of changes in the domain.</li>
<li>DDD techniques can be used in both monolithic and microservices architectures.</li>
<li>Event storming, bounded context canvas, and DDD are iterative processes that require continuous refinement and collaboration between team members.</li>
<li>The speakers emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes and experimenting with different techniques to find the best approach for a given situation.</li>
<li>DDD techniques can be applied in distributed systems and help in shaping the architecture and organization of a team.</li>

<ul>
<li>Software design should be focused on clear communication and intentionality.</li>
<li>Good design requires an understanding of the larger context and history of software design patterns.</li>
<li>Design patterns should be used with respect for their origins and purpose, rather than simply following a trend.</li>
<li>Software design can be influenced by literary techniques, such as using form and flow to communicate intent.</li>
<li>Design patterns should evolve with the changing needs of the software industry.</li>
<li>Good design requires a balance between abstracting complexity and providing clarity.</li>
<li>Abstraction should be used thoughtfully to avoid adding unnecessary complexity.</li>
<li>Design decisions should be made with an understanding of the trade-offs involved.</li>
<li>The design process should be iterative, learning from the software and its users over time.</li>
<li>The goal of good design is to create software that is easy to understand, maintain, and modify.</li>
<li>Good design should be timeless and adaptable to new contexts and requirements.</li>
<li>Designers should be aware of the impact of their design choices on the long-term maintainability of the software.</li>
<li>Design should focus on creating a cohesive and organized code base, with clear communication of intent.</li>
<li>Good design should be able to adapt to changing requirements and maintain its clarity and effectiveness over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the context and history of design patterns, as well as the need for an iterative and thoughtful design process. Good design should be adaptable, clear, and maintainable, with a focus on intentionality and communication.</p>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96rkexbc2Ag">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96rkexbc2Ag</a></p>
<p>Key points from the transcript:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identity is crucial in serverless architecture and applications.</li>
<li>Idempotency is an important principle in designing serverless systems.</li>
<li>Idempotency ensures that an operation's outcome remains the same even if it's performed multiple times.</li>
<li>The term "idempotent" comes from the fields of mathematics and computing.</li>
<li>In the context of serverless applications, idempotent operations help prevent side effects and duplicate requests.</li>
<li>To implement idempotency, use libraries and APIs that support identity checks.</li>
<li>Examples of such libraries and APIs include Stripe API, Nugget package, and Cisco APIs.</li>
<li>Idempotency can be achieved through persistent storage, such as DynamoDB, and using decorators to manage request identifiers.</li>
<li>Durable functions (e.g., Azure Orchestrator) can help manage retries and ensure idempotency in asynchronous transactions.</li>
<li>Identity maps, such as the one provided by Stripe API, can help manage and store keys and results, making it easier to scale applications.</li>
<li>The three key elements of implementing idempotency in serverless systems include identity, persistence, and retry mechanisms.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker, Jeremy Miller, presents an alternative view on software architecture, focusing on problems in large, long-running systems.</li>
<li>Key issues highlighted include:</li>
<li>Large, tightly coupled systems can become difficult to manage and maintain.</li>
<li>Database abstraction can lead to over-engineered, heavy solutions.</li>
<li>Prescriptive architectural patterns like Clean Architecture, Onion Architecture, and Hexagonal Architecture can be overly restrictive and sometimes unnecessary.</li>
<li>Developers should avoid excessive abstraction, which can add complexity and reduce clarity.</li>
<li>Using a microservices approach can help isolate problems, but might introduce its own challenges such as inter-service communication and coordination.</li>
<li>Infrastructure and business logic should be separated to promote maintainability and predictability.</li>
<li>Testing is crucial, but overemphasis on integration testing can sometimes lead to over-engineered solutions.</li>
<li>Adopting an Aframe architecture, which separates business logic from data handling and coordination, can help manage complexity in large systems.</li>
<li>The speaker suggests that developers should:</li>
<li>Be careful when following prescriptive architectural patterns.</li>
<li>Focus on keeping code maintainable and understandable.</li>
<li>Use appropriate abstraction levels to solve real problems.</li>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnDchr5eabI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnDchr5eabI</a></p>
<p>Here are the key points from the transcript:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event Sourcing: </li>
<li>Focuses on capturing events as the primary source of information rather than the current state.</li>
<li>Events are immutable and contain specific information, such as logging incident details.</li>
<li>
<p>Event Sourcing allows for precise diagnostics, better understanding of the system, and easier debugging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even Sourcing vs Classical Approach:</p>
</li>
<li>Even Sourcing simplifies the architecture by separating read and write operations.</li>
<li>It provides strong consistency and a history of the entire system.</li>
<li>
<p>Even Sourcing is more connected and relies on DDD principles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits of Event Sourcing:</p>
</li>
<li>Simplified testing, as events are predictable and maintainable.</li>
<li>Powerful granular information for precise diagnostics.</li>
<li>Easier handling of incidents and better incident categorization.</li>
<li>
<p>Strong consistency and better handling of optimistic concurrency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges:</p>
</li>
<li>Even Sourcing can be perceived as hard to implement.</li>
<li>Requires careful handling of data and version control.</li>
<li>
<p>Optimistic concurrency can be complex to manage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event Sourcing Implementation:</p>
</li>
<li>Martin Fowler's approach involves using a postgres event store, which allows for a simple storage pattern.</li>
<li>The event store is a key-value database that stores events and their metadata.</li>
<li>
<p>Even Sourcing can be used with document databases, such as MongoDB, but it is essential to understand the database's characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projection:</p>
</li>
<li>Projections are read models that serve specific use cases and queries.</li>
<li>They can be built using various technologies and can be optimized for performance and readability.</li>
<li>
<p>Projections can help reduce cognitive load by providing a clear and concise view of specific data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event Sourcing Patterns:</p>
</li>
<li>Event Sourcing can be combined with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) to optimize read and write operations.</li>
<li>Even Sourcing can be used with messaging systems, such as Kafka or RabbitMQ, to handle events and stream data.</li>
<li>Even Sourcing can also be used with SignalR for real-time notifications and communication between the server and clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Event Sourcing is a powerful pattern that captures events as the primary source of information, enabling precise diagnostics, strong consistency, and simplified testing. It requires careful handling of data and version control but can be combined with various technologies and patterns, such as CQRS, messaging systems, and SignalR, to optimize the overall system's performance and maintainability.</p>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQOM-UrNTS4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQOM-UrNTS4</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Coupling is a crucial aspect of software design, affecting maintainability, flexibility, and changeability.</li>
<li>Two types of coupling: structural and behavioral. Structural coupling refers to the interdependence of components through code, while behavioral coupling relates to how components interact with each other.</li>
<li>Balancing coupling means designing systems with manageable interdependencies, minimizing the impact of changes in one part of the system on others.</li>
<li>Designing modular systems involves understanding the nature of coupling, its dimensions, and how it affects system design.</li>
<li>The three dimensions of coupling are:</li>
<li>Strength: The degree of interdependence between components.</li>
<li>Volatility: The rate of change of components.</li>
<li>Distance: The physical separation between components.</li>
<li>High coupling strength increases the risk of cascading changes and high maintenance effort, while high volatility requires more communication and coordination.</li>
<li>Decoupling components can reduce the risk of cascading changes, but extreme decoupling can lead to a loss of coherence and increased complexity.</li>
<li>Design patterns like Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Bounded Context can help manage coupling by defining clear boundaries and organizing components around business concepts.</li>
<li>Using microservices and serverless functions can also help balance coupling by isolating parts of the system and reducing interdependencies.</li>
<li>Anticorruption layers and event-sourcing can help manage interactions between bounded contexts and minimize the impact of changes in one context on another.</li>

<ul>
<li>Introduction to Residuality Theory: A new way of thinking about software systems, focusing on understanding the interaction between ordered and disordered systems.</li>
<li>Traditional software architecture has treated disordered systems like ordered systems, which often leads to failure.</li>
<li>The key is to identify and manage residues, which are the leftover components in a system that are still functioning and connected.</li>
<li>Residuality Theory offers a way to understand complex systems and their behavior by identifying residues and their interactions.</li>
<li>The theory uses random simulation, network analysis, and Kaufman Networks to model and analyze software systems.</li>
<li>Kaufman Networks can help identify attractors, which are patterns of behavior in a system, and understand how they interact with residues.</li>
<li>By understanding the interactions between ordered and disordered systems, software architects can design more resilient systems that can survive unpredictable stressors.</li>
<li>Residuality Theory can help software engineers manage complexity, reduce risk, and improve the reliability of software systems.</li>

<li>Container apps features: Scaling (up and down), zero instance, automatic health checks, and self-healing capabilities.</li>
<li>Scaling options: Choose between zero, one, or multiple instances, and use Azure service bus or event-driven scaling based on metrics like number of HTTP requests, message queue size, etc.</li>
<li>Container apps pricing: Consumption plan allows for pay-as-you-go, based on resource usage (CPU and memory) and number of requests.</li>
<li>Preview features: Container app copilot (AI-based assistance for application management) and other upcoming features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q&amp;A Session:</p>
<p>Q: What are the primary benefits of using Dapper and container apps together for microservices?</p>
<p>A: The primary benefits of using Dapper and container apps together for microservices include:
- Simplified development: Dapper abstracts away complexities around service discovery, pub-sub messaging, state management, and more, making it easier for developers to build microservices.
- Improved resiliency: Dapper handles resiliency features like retries, exponential backoffs, circuit breakers, and handling timeouts, ensuring the microservices are robust and fault-tolerant.
- Enhanced scalability: Container apps support easy scaling up and down, as well as zero instance mode, allowing for efficient resource usage.
- Better cost management: Consumption plan allows for pay-as-you-go pricing based on resource usage and number of requests, enabling cost optimization.
- Easier maintenance and updates: Dapper's sidecar pattern and revision concept make it simple to rollback and switch between different versions of a microservice without downtime.
- Accelerated deployment: Container apps support quick and easy deployment using CLI or bicep, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure management.</p>
<p>Q: Can Dapper be used with other cloud platforms or is it specific to Azure?</p>
<p>A: Dapper is an open-source framework that can be used with any cloud platform or even on-premises environments. Although the presentation focuses on using Dapper with Azure container apps, it is not limited to Azure and can be adapted to other cloud platforms or even custom environments.</p>
<p>Q: How does Dapper handle service discovery?</p>
<p>A: Dapper abstracts away the complexity of service discovery by providing a built-in service registry. The registry keeps track of the available services and their current states (running, stopping, or failed). Dapper automatically updates the registry as services start, stop, or fail, and services can query the registry to discover other services and their endpoints. This simplifies service discovery and makes it more reliable, as Dapper handles the registry updates and caching automatically.</p>
<p>Q: Can you give an example of how Dapper handles resiliency?</p>
<p>A: Certainly! Dapper provides built-in resiliency features to handle failures and retries gracefully. Here are some examples:
- Retries: Dapper automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoffs, reducing the impact of transient failures.
- Circuit breaker: Dapper implements circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures by detecting and handling failures in dependent services.
- Timeouts: Dapper supports timeouts for requests and retries, ensuring that a single failure does not block the entire system indefinitely.
- Health checks: Dapper performs health checks on services to determine their availability and routing traffic accordingly.</p>
<p>These resiliency features help maintain the reliability and robustness of microservices built with Dapper.</p>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjqZLEyS5ww">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjqZLEyS5ww</a></p>
<p>In this talk, William Brander discusses the top 5 techniques for building the worst microservice system ever, and he humorously highlights the challenges and pitfalls of microservices.</p>
<ol>
<li>Strangler Fig Pattern: Start with a monolith and incrementally extract functionality into separate microservices. This often results in increasing system complexity and decreased performance.</li>
<li>Big Bang Rewrite: Attempt a complete rewrite of the system, which is likely to introduce new problems, especially network operations, tight coupling, and increased latency due to contention and garbage collection issues.</li>
<li>Use Off-the-Shelf Frameworks: Relying on popular frameworks may lead to tight coupling between services, making the system difficult to change or maintain.</li>
<li>Define Service Boundaries Based on Verbs: Instead of defining service boundaries based on nouns (entities), defining them based on verbs (actions) can lead to cross-service communication and tight coupling.</li>
<li>Encourage Cross-Service Communication: Although cross-service communication can be a good way to share data, it can also lead to tight coupling, conflation of logical and physical boundaries, and difficulty in scaling or changing individual services.</li>
</ol>
<p>William Brander emphasizes that microservices are not always the best solution, and that developers should carefully consider the downsides and trade-offs of building microservices.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ignat Korchagin discussed sandboxing in Linux without writing any code, focusing on the Linux kernel and its security features.</li>
<li>He emphasized the importance of understanding system calls and their role in separating user space (application logic) from kernel space (system calls and kernel functions).</li>
<li>Korchagin introduced seccomp, a Linux security feature that allows enforcing system call policies to restrict what a process can do.</li>
<li>He demonstrated how to use setcom to create policies and deny lists, which can be applied to processes using the systemd unit file or by preloading libraries with LD_PRELOAD.</li>
<li>The sandboxing toolkit consists of two parts: a shared library for dynamic linking and a special launcher for statically linked applications.</li>
<li>Korchagin suggested using the lip sandboxing approach, which provides tighter access control and a smaller allow list, reducing the attack surface for applications.</li>
<li>He recommended using the lipac comp library, contributing to its GitHub project, and referring to the documentation for seccomp, systemd, and filter directives for further understanding and implementation.</li>

<ul>
<li>Event-driven architecture: A design pattern that uses events as the primary mechanism for communication between microservices.</li>
<li>Core idea: Instead of using request/response communication, components in an event-driven system communicate by publishing and subscribing to events.</li>
<li>Benefits: Enables loose coupling, increased scalability, and faster event processing.</li>
<li>Challenges: Eventual consistency, handling events that fail to be published, and managing a large number of events.</li>
<li>EDA (Event-Driven Architecture): A system design that focuses on event communication between components.</li>
<li>CQRS: A pattern for splitting a system into two completely independent services - one for command processing (CRUD operations) and another for querying (read-only operations).</li>
<li>Outbox pattern: A pattern to handle failed transactions by storing uncommitted data in a separate table (outbox) and using CQRS to deal with the eventual consistency.</li>
<li>Change Data Capture (CDC): A technique that captures changes in the database and publishes them as events. This allows for real-time read operations and optimizing data structure for specific use cases.</li>
<li>Observability: Important in event-driven systems to understand the cause and effect of events.</li>
<li>Event storming: An event-driven design workshop where participants collaboratively model the system using events.</li>
<li>Event Ren: Refers to the event architecture, a communication pattern way of modeling integration in a system.</li>
<li>Event architecture: A way of thinking about integration, decoupling, and communication in a system.</li>
<li>Event-driven communication: A communication model where components communicate by publishing and reacting to events.</li>
<li>Event storming workshop: A collaborative workshop to model an event-driven system.</li>
<li>EDA vs. Traditional monolithic architecture: EDA can be used in both monolithic systems and microservices systems.</li>
<li>Event-driven microservices: A microservices architecture where services communicate using event-driven communication.</li>
<li>Event bus: A component in an event-driven system that facilitates event routing.</li>
<li>Metadata and data schema: In an event-driven system, events often contain metadata and data payload.</li>
<li>Eventual consistency: A consistency model where eventually all replicas will have the same state, but at any given time, different replicas may have different states.</li>
<li>Synchronous and asynchronous communication: Asynchronous communication (like events) allows components to operate independently without waiting for a response.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key Takeaways:
- Event-driven architecture is a design pattern that promotes loose coupling and increased scalability.
- Event storming is a collaborative workshop for modeling an event-driven system.
- Event-driven microservices communication model helps create systems that can evolve and scale rapidly.
- Eventual consistency is a consistency model where eventually all replicas will have the same state.
- CQRS and outbox pattern are techniques to handle events and data storage in an event-driven system.</p>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-MOtcat1iE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-MOtcat1iE</a></p>
<p>In this talk, Sam Newman discusses the concepts of asynchronous communication, synchronous communication, and the terms' relationship to one another. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the context of these terms when discussing system architecture and interprocess communication. Key points covered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous communication: A method where messages are sent without requiring an immediate response. It helps in decoupling the sender and receiver and allows for better handling of latency and parallel processing.</li>
<li>Synchronous communication: A method where messages are sent and received in a sequence, often requiring an immediate response. It can lead to tight coupling between the sender and receiver.</li>
<li>Event-driven communication: A type of asynchronous communication where the sender sends data, and the receiver processes it at a later time, often in response to an event.</li>
<li>Nonblocking and blocking calls: These terms refer to the behavior of a call in a system, where blocking calls are those that wait for a response before continuing, and nonblocking calls proceed without waiting for a response.</li>
<li>Intermediaries: These are elements that help manage the communication between services, often used to handle temporal decoupling and improve system resilience.</li>
<li>The Reactive Manifesto: A document that outlines principles for creating reactive systems, which often rely on asynchronous communication.</li>
<li>Terminology: Sam argues that the terms "asynchronous" and "synchronous" have caused confusion, and that better understanding of context can help clarify discussions around system architecture and interprocess communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Sam Newman discusses the nuances of asynchronous and synchronous communication, emphasizing the importance of context and clear definitions when designing and discussing systems. The talk highlights the role of intermediaries, event-driven communication, and the Reactive Manifesto in building resilient and scalable systems.</p>

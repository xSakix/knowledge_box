<p><strong>NDC 2024 London: Keynote - Gerald - "The Future of Cross-Platform Development with Blazer"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The National Developer Conference (NDC) 2024 London was a remarkable event that brought together some of the most brilliant minds in the world of software development. On one of the keynote sessions, Gerald took the stage to talk about the future of cross-platform development with Blazer. In this chapter, we will delve into the transcript of that keynote session and explore the exciting possibilities that Blazer has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem with Cross-Platform Development</strong></p>
<p>Gerald started his keynote by highlighting the challenges that developers face when it comes to cross-platform development. He pointed out that building applications that run on multiple platforms, such as iOS, Android, and Windows, is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of each platform's specific requirements and quirks.</p>
<p>"But," he said, "what if I told you that there's a way to build cross-platform applications that run natively on multiple platforms, without sacrificing performance or functionality?" The audience was intrigued, and Gerald continued to explain the concept of Blazer.</p>
<p><strong>What is Blazer?</strong></p>
<p>Blazer is a new technology that allows developers to build native applications for multiple platforms using a single codebase. It's based on the .NET framework and uses the WebAssembly (WASM) format to compile the code. This means that the same code can be run on multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and Windows, without the need for platform-specific code.</p>
<p>Gerald demonstrated the power of Blazer by showing how he built a simple application using the .NET framework and then ran it on multiple platforms. The audience was amazed by the seamless experience and the ease with which the application worked across platforms.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits of Blazer</strong></p>
<p>Gerald highlighted several benefits of using Blazer for cross-platform development. Firstly, it eliminates the need for platform-specific code, which reduces the complexity and maintenance burden of building and maintaining multiple versions of the same application.</p>
<p>Secondly, Blazer allows developers to reuse code across platforms, which means that changes made to the codebase can be easily propagated to all platforms. This reduces the time and effort required to maintain multiple versions of the same application.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Blazer provides a single, unified API for all platforms, which simplifies the development process and makes it easier to develop and test applications.</p>
<p><strong>Building a Blazer Application</strong></p>
<p>Gerald then showed the audience how to build a Blazer application using the .NET framework. He demonstrated how to create a new Blazer project, add a user interface, and write code that runs natively on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>He also showed how to use the Blazer web view component to render a web-based application within the native application, allowing developers to reuse existing web-based code and skills.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges and Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Gerald also discussed some of the challenges and opportunities that come with using Blazer. He pointed out that while Blazer provides a lot of benefits, it also requires a new set of skills and knowledge to develop and maintain.</p>
<p>He also highlighted the importance of community involvement and collaboration in the development of Blazer, and encouraged the audience to get involved and contribute to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, Gerald's keynote on Blazer at NDC 2024 London was an exciting and informative session that showcased the potential of this new technology. By eliminating the need for platform-specific code and providing a single, unified API for all platforms, Blazer has the potential to revolutionize the way we build cross-platform applications.</p>
<p>The audience was left with a sense of excitement and anticipation, eager to see what the future holds for Blazer and the possibilities it offers. As Gerald said, "The future of cross-platform development is here, and it's called Blazer."</p>

<h1 id="ndc-2024-london-the-art-of-logging-by-nick-chapsas">NDC 2024 London: "The Art of Logging" by Nick Chapsas</h1>
<p>At the NDC 2024 London conference, Nick Chapsas took the stage to talk about the art of logging. As a software engineer and engineering manager, Nick has extensive experience in the field of logging and has a deep understanding of its importance. In this chapter, we will explore the key takeaways from his talk.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem with Logging</strong></p>
<p>Logging is a crucial aspect of software development. It allows us to understand what is happening within our applications, troubleshoot issues, and identify performance bottlenecks. However, logging can also be a complex and time-consuming task. Nick started his talk by highlighting the problems with logging, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sheer volume of logs generated, making it difficult to find the relevant information</li>
<li>The complexity of log formats, making it hard to parse and analyze the data</li>
<li>The lack of consistency in log naming conventions, making it difficult to understand the context of the logs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Importance of Structured Logging</strong></p>
<p>Nick emphasized the importance of structured logging, where logs are formatted in a specific way to make them easier to parse and analyze. He advocated for using log levels, such as debug, info, warning, and error, to provide context to the logs. He also highlighted the importance of using a consistent naming convention for log messages, such as using a specific format for log messages.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits of Interpolation</strong></p>
<p>Nick discussed the benefits of using interpolation in logging. Interpolation allows us to embed values into log messages, making it easier to provide context to the logs. He demonstrated how interpolation can be used to create log messages that are both informative and concise.</p>
<p><strong>The Dangers of Boxing</strong></p>
<p>Nick warned against the dangers of boxing, which is the process of converting a value to a string and then boxing it. Boxing can be expensive and can lead to performance issues. He demonstrated how boxing can be avoided by using interpolation and structured logging.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Log Level</strong></p>
<p>Nick emphasized the importance of log level, which determines the level of detail provided in the logs. He advocated for using a log level of "warning" or "error" to provide context to the logs, rather than using a log level of "debug" or "info", which can provide too much detail.</p>
<p><strong>The Art of Logging</strong></p>
<p>Nick concluded his talk by emphasizing the importance of logging as an art. He emphasized that logging is not just about writing code, but about understanding the context of the application and providing meaningful information to the logs. He encouraged the audience to think carefully about their logging strategy and to strive for simplicity, consistency, and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, Nick's talk on the art of logging provided valuable insights into the importance of structured logging, the benefits of interpolation, and the dangers of boxing. He emphasized the importance of log level and encouraged the audience to think carefully about their logging strategy. The talk was informative, engaging, and provided a fresh perspective on the often-overlooked topic of logging.</p>

<h3 id="transcript">Transcript</h3>
<p>[Start of the talk]</p>
<p>Nick: Hello everybody, I'm Nick Chapas, and welcome to my talk on the art of logging. I'm a software engineer and engineering manager, and I've had the pleasure of working with logging for many years. Today, I want to talk about the importance of logging, the problems with logging, and how we can improve our logging strategy.</p>
<p>[Start of the presentation]</p>
<p>Nick: The first problem with logging is the sheer volume of logs generated. With so many logs being generated, it's difficult to find the relevant information. The second problem is the complexity of log formats. Log formats can be complex, making it hard to parse and analyze the data. And the third problem is the lack of consistency in log naming conventions. Log naming conventions can be inconsistent, making it difficult to understand the context of the logs.</p>
<p>[Slide: "The Problems with Logging"]</p>
<p>Nick: Now, let's talk about the importance of structured logging. Structured logging is the process of formatting logs in a specific way to make them easier to parse and analyze. It's crucial to use log levels, such as debug, info, warning, and error, to provide context to the logs. And it's also important to use a consistent naming convention for log messages.</p>
<p>[Slide: "Structured Logging"]</p>
<p>Nick: Now, let's talk about the benefits of interpolation. Interpolation is the process of embedding values into log messages. It allows us to provide context to the logs and make them more informative. Interpolation can be used to create log messages that are both concise and informative.</p>
<p>[Slide: "Interpolation"]</p>
<p>Nick: Now, let's talk about the dangers of boxing. Boxing is the process of converting a value to a string and then boxing it. Boxing can be expensive and can lead to performance issues. It's important to avoid boxing and use interpolation instead.</p>
<p>[Slide: "Boxing"]</p>
<p>Nick: Now, let's talk about the importance of log level. Log level determines the level of detail provided in the logs. It's important to use a log level of "warning" or "error" to provide context to the logs, rather than using a log level of "debug" or "info", which can provide too much detail.</p>
<p>[Slide: "Log Level"]</p>
<p>Nick: In conclusion, logging is not just about writing code, but about understanding the context of the application and providing meaningful information to the logs. It's an art that requires careful consideration and attention to detail. I hope this talk has provided valuable insights into the importance of structured logging, the benefits of interpolation, and the dangers of boxing. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>NDC 2024 London: A Journey Through the World of Technology</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 6: The Art of Secure Communication</strong></p>
<p>The NDC 2024 London conference was a testament to the ever-evolving world of technology. With talks on various topics, from AI to cybersecurity, the event was a melting pot of innovation and expertise. One of the most engaging talks of the conference was on the art of secure communication, presented by Scott Im, a security professional with a background in traditional security consultancy.</p>
<p><strong>The Basics of Secure Communication</strong></p>
<p>Scott began by explaining the basics of secure communication. He started with the concept of protocol encryption, referring to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which is widely used to secure online communications. He explained that TLS is used to encrypt data in transit, making it unreadable to anyone intercepting it.</p>
<p><strong>The Flaws of RSA Key Exchange</strong></p>
<p>Scott then delved into the flaws of the RSA key exchange mechanism, which is used to establish a secure connection between two parties. He explained that the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, also known as the Diffie-Hellman key agreement, is a widely used method for establishing a shared secret key between two parties. However, this method has a fatal flaw, which allows an attacker to intercept and decrypt the shared key.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Quantum Computing</strong></p>
<p>Scott then touched on the rise of quantum computing and its potential impact on encryption. He explained that quantum computers can perform calculations much faster than classical computers, making it possible to break certain encryption methods. He highlighted the importance of post-quantum cryptography, which is designed to be resistant to attacks by quantum computers.</p>
<p><strong>The Need for Forward Secrecy</strong></p>
<p>Scott emphasized the importance of forward secrecy, which ensures that even if a shared secret key is compromised, the communication remains secure. He explained that the Diffie-Hellman key exchange does not provide forward secrecy, making it vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution: ECDHE</strong></p>
<p>Scott introduced the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) key exchange, which provides forward secrecy. He explained that ECDHE uses a randomly generated ephemeral key pair, which is discarded after use, making it impossible for an attacker to intercept and decrypt the shared key.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Widespread Adoption</strong></p>
<p>Scott emphasized the importance of widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography and the need for a transition from traditional encryption methods. He highlighted the need for developers to start using new cryptographic primitives and protocols to ensure the security of online communications.</p>
<p><strong>The Future of Secure Communication</strong></p>
<p>Scott concluded his talk by discussing the future of secure communication. He emphasized the need for continued innovation and the development of new cryptographic primitives and protocols. He also highlighted the importance of raising awareness among the general population about the importance of security and privacy online.</p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A Session</strong></p>
<p>The talk was followed by a Q&amp;A session, where attendees had the opportunity to ask questions and engage with Scott. One attendee asked about the potential impact of quantum computing on encryption, to which Scott replied that it's essential to start using post-quantum cryptography to ensure the security of online communications.</p>
<p>Another attendee asked about the ease of implementation of ECDHE, to which Scott replied that it's relatively straightforward and that many libraries and frameworks already support it. He also emphasized the importance of testing and auditing to ensure the security of implementations.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Scott's talk on the art of secure communication was both informative and engaging, providing attendees with a deeper understanding of the importance of security and privacy online. His discussion on the flaws of traditional encryption methods and the need for post-quantum cryptography was timely and relevant, highlighting the need for continued innovation and awareness in the field of cybersecurity.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 6: "Building Long-Running Background Work with .NET and the Hosted Services Pattern"</strong></p>
<p>At the NDC 2024 London conference, Steve Gordon presented a session on building long-running background work with .NET and the hosted services pattern. In this chapter, we'll explore the transcript of the session.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Steve Gordon: "Hey, everyone! Welcome to my session on building long-running background work with .NET and the hosted services pattern. I'm Steve Gordon, and I'll be your guide through this journey. We'll explore the concepts, the code, and the best practices for building long-running background work in .NET."</p>
<p><strong>The Problem with Long-Running Background Work</strong></p>
<p>Steve Gordon: "So, let's start with the problem. We've all been there - we have a long-running background task that needs to run in our application. Maybe it's processing data, or running some heavy computations. But, what happens when our application is shut down? What happens when the user closes the browser, or the server restarts? The task just disappears, right? We need a way to keep it running, even when our application is no longer active."</p>
<p><strong>The Hosted Services Pattern</strong></p>
<p>Steve Gordon: "That's where the hosted services pattern comes in. It's a way to decouple our long-running background work from our application's lifetime. We can use the hosted services pattern to create a background service that runs independently of our application. This way, even if our application is shut down, the background service will continue to run."</p>
<p><strong>Implementing the Hosted Services Pattern</strong></p>
<p>Steve Gordon: "So, let's dive into the code. We'll start by creating a new .NET Core project. We'll add the <code>Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting</code> NuGet package, and then create a new class that implements the <code>IHostedService</code> interface. This interface has two methods: <code>StartAsync</code> and <code>StopAsync</code>.</p>
<p>"Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class MyBackgroundService : IHostedService
{
    public Task StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Start the background work here
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task StopAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Stop the background work here
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Cancelling the Background Service</strong></p>
<p>Steve Gordon: "Now, let's talk about cancelling the background service. We need a way to cancel the service when our application is shut down. We can do this by using a cancellation token. We'll pass the cancellation token to the <code>StartAsync</code> method, and then check for cancellation inside the method.</p>
<p>"Here's the updated code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public Task StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    while (!cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        // Do some work
    }
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Hosted Services Builder</strong></p>
<p>Steve Gordon: "Now that we have our background service implemented, we need to add it to the hosted services collection. We can do this using the <code>IHostBuilder</code> interface. We'll add an instance of our background service to the <code>Services</code> collection, and then use the <code>Build</code> method to create an instance of the <code>IHost</code> interface.</p>
<p>"Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var builder = new HostBuilder();
        builder.Services.AddHostedService&lt;MyBackgroundService&gt;();
        var host = builder.Build();
        host.Start();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Steve Gordon: "And that's it! We've implemented the hosted services pattern in .NET, and we've created a long-running background service that runs independently of our application. We've also learned how to cancel the background service using a cancellation token. This is a powerful pattern that can help us build more robust and scalable applications. Thanks for joining me on this journey, and I hope you'll take this knowledge back to your own projects."</p>

<h1 id="ndc-2024-london-a-journey-through-modular-monoliths-and-microservices">NDC 2024 London: A Journey Through Modular Monoliths and Microservices</h1>
<p>The NDC 2024 London conference was a thrilling event that brought together some of the brightest minds in the software development industry. One of the most memorable talks was given by Lea, who took the stage to discuss the importance of modular monoliths and the challenges of transitioning to microservices architecture.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem with Microservices</strong></p>
<p>Lea began by highlighting the common pitfalls of microservices architecture. "Microservices are great, but they're not a solution to every problem," she said. "In fact, they can be a recipe for disaster if not implemented correctly."</p>
<p>Lea pointed out that microservices can lead to complexity, increased maintenance, and difficulty in debugging. "When you break down a monolith into smaller services, you're not just breaking down the code, you're also breaking down the architecture," she said. "And once you've broken it down, it's hard to put it back together again."</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits of Modular Monoliths</strong></p>
<p>So, what's the alternative to microservices? Lea advocated for the use of modular monoliths. "A modular monolith is a single executable that contains multiple modules, each with its own responsibility," she explained. "It's like a Swiss Army knife - it may not be the best tool for every job, but it's a great tool for many jobs."</p>
<p>Lea emphasized the benefits of modular monoliths, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Modular monoliths are simpler to understand and maintain than microservices.</li>
<li><strong>Easier debugging</strong>: With a modular monolith, you can debug individual modules without affecting the entire system.</li>
<li><strong>Faster deployment</strong>: Modular monoliths can be deployed quickly and easily, without the need for complex orchestration.</li>
<li><strong>Better scalability</strong>: Modular monoliths can scale horizontally, making it easier to handle increased traffic and demand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Journey to Modular Monoliths</strong></p>
<p>So, how can you transition from a monolith to a modular monolith? Lea outlined the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify the boundaries</strong>: Identify the natural boundaries of your application, and use these to define the modules.</li>
<li><strong>Decompose the monolith</strong>: Decompose the monolith into smaller modules, each with its own responsibility.</li>
<li><strong>Create a modular architecture</strong>: Create a modular architecture that reflects the decomposition of the monolith.</li>
<li><strong>Implement loose coupling</strong>: Implement loose coupling between the modules, using interfaces and abstractions to facilitate communication.</li>
<li><strong>Test and refactor</strong>: Test and refactor the modules to ensure they work correctly and independently.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Importance of Architecture</strong></p>
<p>Throughout her talk, Lea emphasized the importance of architecture in software development. "Architecture is not just about designing the system, it's about designing the system's future," she said. "It's about creating a system that is flexible, scalable, and maintainable."</p>
<p>Lea also highlighted the importance of testing and refactoring in ensuring the quality of the system. "Testing and refactoring are not just activities, they're disciplines," she said. "They're essential for ensuring that the system meets the requirements and is maintainable in the long term."</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, Lea's talk provided a thought-provoking look at the challenges and benefits of modular monoliths and microservices architecture. She emphasized the importance of simplicity, ease of debugging, and scalability in software development, and provided practical steps for transitioning from a monolith to a modular monolith.</p>
<p>As the audience left the conference hall, they were left with a renewed appreciation for the importance of architecture and the benefits of modular monoliths. Lea's talk was a timely reminder that, in the words of the great architect, "a good architecture is like a good joke - it's all about the setup and the punchline."</p>

<p><strong>NDC 2024 London: The Open Source Conundrum</strong></p>
<p>As the sun set over the bustling streets of London, the NDC 2024 conference came to a close with a thought-provoking keynote from a passionate advocate for open source software. David, the director of architecture at New Day, took the stage to discuss the perils of open source exploitation and the need for change in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem with Open Source</strong></p>
<p>David began by acknowledging the importance of open source software, which has enabled the development of many popular technologies and has democratized access to software development. However, he also highlighted the darker side of open source, where large corporations exploit the freedom and flexibility of open source software for their own gain.</p>
<p>"We've seen the rise of companies using open source software as a way to extract free labor from developers, while making huge profits for themselves," David said. "It's a classic example of exploitation, where the value created by the open source community is being used to line the pockets of large corporations."</p>
<p>David cited the example of Docker, which has become a dominant player in the containerization market, despite being based on open source technology. "Docker's success is built on the shoulders of the open source community, but they've managed to monetize their platform by charging exorbitant prices for their commercial support and services," he said.</p>
<p><strong>The GPL and the Myth of Free</strong></p>
<p>David also delved into the history of the GNU General Public License (GPL), which was created to ensure that software remains free and open. However, he argued that the GPL has been misused by companies seeking to exploit the open source community.</p>
<p>"The GPL was intended to be a way to ensure that software remains free and open, but it's been used as a way to restrict the use of software and to lock out competitors," David said. "The GPL is a relic of the past, and it's time for a new approach to open source licensing."</p>
<p>David also touched on the concept of "free" in the context of software. "When we talk about free software, we often mean 'free as in beer', but we forget that the true value of software lies in its freedom to use, modify, and distribute," he said. "The idea of 'free' has been hijacked by companies that want to make a quick buck off the back of open source software."</p>
<p><strong>The Need for Change</strong></p>
<p>David concluded his keynote by emphasizing the need for change in the open source industry. "We need to recognize that open source software is not just a way to get free labor, but a way to create value for the community," he said. "We need to adopt a new approach to open source licensing that prioritizes the freedom and autonomy of developers, rather than the profits of large corporations."</p>
<p>David also called for greater transparency and accountability in the open source community, citing the example of companies like Microsoft and Google, which have been accused of exploiting open source software for their own gain.</p>
<p>"We need to hold companies accountable for their actions, and we need to recognize that open source software is not just a way to get cheap labor, but a way to create value for the community," he said.</p>
<p><strong>The Future of Open Source</strong></p>
<p>As the keynote came to a close, David left the audience with a sense of hope and urgency. "We can create a better future for open source software, but we need to be willing to challenge the status quo and to demand more from companies that claim to be committed to open source values," he said.</p>
<p>The audience applauded as David concluded his keynote, and the conference continued with a series of workshops and sessions that explored the latest developments in open source software and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The NDC 2024 conference was a powerful reminder of the importance of open source software and the need for change in the industry. David's keynote was a call to action, urging developers and companies to recognize the value of open source software and to work towards a more sustainable and equitable future for the community.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 7: NDC 2024 London - Cryptography and the Future of Security</strong></p>
<p>The NDC 2024 London conference was a thrilling experience, filled with insightful talks and discussions on the latest trends and innovations in the world of software development. One of the most memorable talks was given by Rob Conor, a renowned cryptographer, who delved into the world of cryptography and the future of security.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Cryptography</strong></p>
<p>Cryptography is the practice of securing sensitive information by transforming it into a code that can only be deciphered by those with the right key or password. In his talk, Rob Conor emphasized the importance of cryptography in today's digital age, where data breaches and cyber attacks are becoming increasingly common.</p>
<p>"Cryptography is not just about keeping data safe," Rob said. "It's about giving people the confidence to share information online without worrying about it being stolen or compromised."</p>
<p>Rob began his talk by explaining the basics of cryptography, including the concept of public and private keys, and the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption. He then delved into the world of RSA, a widely used algorithm for secure data transmission.</p>
<p><strong>The RSA Algorithm</strong></p>
<p>RSA, which stands for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, is a public-key encryption algorithm that uses a pair of large prime numbers to encode and decode messages. The algorithm is based on the principle of factoring large numbers, which is a difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>"We use RSA to encrypt data and ensure that only the intended recipient can decrypt it," Rob explained. "The algorithm is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, which makes it virtually impossible to crack without the right key."</p>
<p>Rob also talked about the importance of prime numbers in cryptography, and how they are used to create the public and private keys used in RSA.</p>
<p><strong>The Quantum Computing Threat</strong></p>
<p>However, Rob also warned about the threat posed by quantum computers, which are capable of solving complex mathematical problems much faster than classical computers.</p>
<p>"Quantum computers are a game-changer in the world of cryptography," Rob said. "They can crack RSA keys in a matter of minutes, which makes it essential for us to develop new algorithms that are resistant to quantum attacks."</p>
<p>Rob mentioned that the quantum computing threat is not just a theoretical concept, but a real possibility that we need to prepare for.</p>

<h1 id="ndc-2024-london-event-architecture-by-james-east">NDC 2024 London: "Event Architecture" by James East</h1>
<p>At the 2024 London edition of the NDC conference, James East took the stage to share his insights on "Event Architecture". As a senior Cloud Architect at AWS, James has extensive experience in designing and implementing scalable and resilient architectures. In this chapter, we'll delve into the key takeaways from his talk, focusing on the concepts of event-driven architecture, event storming, and the importance of observability.</p>
<h2 id="event-architecture-the-core-idea">Event Architecture: The Core Idea</h2>
<p>James began by emphasizing the importance of event architecture in modern software development. He defined event architecture as "a way of modeling integration between systems, services, and applications using events as the primary mechanism of communication". This approach allows for loose coupling, scalability, and flexibility, making it an ideal choice for building complex systems.</p>
<p>James stressed that event architecture is not just about publishing and subscribing to events, but rather about designing a system that is driven by events. This means that the system should be able to react to events in a predictable and consistent manner, without relying on direct requests or callbacks.</p>
<h2 id="event-storming-a-collaborative-approach">Event Storming: A Collaborative Approach</h2>
<p>James then introduced the concept of event storming, a collaborative approach to designing event-driven systems. This involves bringing together a team of stakeholders, including developers, business analysts, and domain experts, to discuss and visualize the events that occur in the system.</p>
<p>The event storming process involves creating a shared understanding of the system's behavior by identifying and describing the events that trigger actions and reactions. This approach helps to ensure that everyone involved in the project has a common understanding of the system's requirements and constraints.</p>
<p>James emphasized that event storming is not just a one-time activity, but rather an ongoing process that should be repeated throughout the development cycle. This allows the team to adapt to changing requirements and ensure that the system remains aligned with the business needs.</p>
<h2 id="event-driven-architecture-benefits-and-challenges">Event-Driven Architecture: Benefits and Challenges</h2>
<p>James highlighted the benefits of event-driven architecture, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loose Coupling</strong>: Event-driven systems are decoupled, which makes them more scalable and easier to maintain.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Event-driven systems can be scaled independently, allowing for more efficient use of resources.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Event-driven systems can be adapted to changing business requirements and technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, James also acknowledged the challenges associated with event-driven architecture, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Event-driven systems can be complex and difficult to understand, especially for developers who are new to the concept.</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>: Event-driven systems can be challenging to monitor and debug, as the events can be scattered across multiple systems and services.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="observability-the-key-to-success">Observability: The Key to Success</h2>
<p>James emphasized the importance of observability in event-driven systems. He stressed that observability is not just about collecting logs and metrics, but rather about understanding the behavior of the system and identifying areas for improvement.</p>
<p>James highlighted the following key aspects of observability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-time Data</strong>: Observability requires real-time data to provide insights into the system's behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Correlation</strong>: Observability involves correlating events and metrics to identify patterns and trends.</li>
<li><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong>: Observability enables developers to identify the root cause of issues and troubleshoot problems more effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>James concluded by emphasizing the importance of embracing event-driven architecture and observability in modern software development. He encouraged the audience to take a more proactive approach to designing and implementing event-driven systems, and to prioritize observability as a key aspect of their development process.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion_1">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, James East's talk on "Event Architecture" at the 2024 London edition of the NDC conference provided valuable insights into the benefits and challenges of event-driven architecture. He emphasized the importance of event storming as a collaborative approach to designing event-driven systems, and highlighted the need for observability to ensure the success of these systems.</p>
<p>As developers, it is essential to understand the concepts of event architecture and observability, and to apply these principles in our daily work. By embracing event-driven architecture and prioritizing observability, we can build more scalable, flexible, and resilient systems that meet the changing needs of our customers and users.</p>

<p>At the NDC 2024 London conference, attendees were treated to a fascinating discussion on the latest advancements in AI and machine learning. One of the most anticipated talks was given by Kesha Williams, a renowned expert in the field, who spoke about the Transformers and ChatGPT, two cutting-edge technologies that are revolutionizing the way we interact with machines.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Talk</strong></p>
<p>[Kesha Williams takes the stage, and the audience quiets down in anticipation. She begins by introducing the topic of the day: Transformers and ChatGPT.]</p>
<p>Kesha Williams: Good morning, everyone! I'm Kesha Williams, and I'm super excited to be here today to talk about two of the most exciting technologies in the field of AI and machine learning: Transformers and ChatGPT. As many of you know, I'm a huge science fiction fan, and I've always been fascinated by the idea of artificial intelligence and its potential to transform our world.</p>
<p><strong>The Transformers</strong></p>
<p>Kesha Williams: So, let's start with the Transformers. You might be familiar with the movie franchise, but for those who aren't, Transformers are a type of AI model that can be trained to perform a wide range of tasks, from language translation to image recognition. They're called Transformers because they use a technique called self-attention, which allows them to focus on specific parts of the input data and generate outputs that are more accurate and context-specific.</p>
<p>[The audience looks intrigued, and Kesha Williams continues.]</p>
<p>Kesha Williams: One of the most impressive things about Transformers is their ability to scale. They can be trained on massive datasets and still perform well, even on edge cases. This is because they're designed to be highly parallelizable, which means they can be run on multiple GPUs and CPUs simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT</strong></p>
<p>Kesha Williams: Now, let's talk about ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a type of language model that's specifically designed to generate human-like text. It's trained on a massive dataset of text and can respond to user input in a way that's both natural and engaging. One of the most impressive things about ChatGPT is its ability to understand context and generate responses that are relevant to the conversation.</p>
<p>[The audience looks impressed, and Kesha Williams continues.]</p>
<p>Kesha Williams: But what's really exciting about ChatGPT is its potential to revolutionize the way we interact with machines. Imagine being able to have a conversation with a machine that's as natural as talking to a human. That's what ChatGPT is capable of, and it's going to change the way we live and work in the future.</p>
<p><strong>The Demo</strong></p>
<p>Kesha Williams: Now, I'd like to show you a demo of ChatGPT in action. [She types on her laptop, and the screen comes to life.]</p>
<p>Kesha Williams: As you can see, ChatGPT is able to generate text that's both natural and relevant to the conversation. It's an incredibly powerful tool that has the potential to transform the way we interact with machines.</p>
<p><strong>The Limitations</strong></p>
<p>Kesha Williams: Of course, no technology is perfect, and ChatGPT is no exception. One of the biggest challenges facing ChatGPT is its ability to understand context and generate responses that are relevant to the conversation. This is because it's trained on a massive dataset of text, and sometimes it can get confused or generate responses that are irrelevant.</p>
<p>[The audience nods in understanding, and Kesha Williams continues.]</p>
<p>Kesha Williams: Another challenge facing ChatGPT is its potential to spread misinformation. As with any AI model, there's a risk that ChatGPT could be used to generate false information or propaganda. This is why it's essential that we develop ethical guidelines and regulations for the development and use of AI models like ChatGPT.</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
<p>Kesha Williams: So, what's the future of ChatGPT and Transformers? Well, I believe that these technologies are going to continue to evolve and improve, and we'll see even more amazing things in the future. We'll see more applications of ChatGPT in areas like customer service, education, and healthcare. We'll see more development of Transformers in areas like computer vision and natural language processing.</p>
<p>[The audience applauds, and Kesha Williams concludes her talk.]</p>
<p>Kesha Williams: Thank you all for listening, and I hope you have a better understanding of the exciting world of ChatGPT and Transformers. Remember, the future is bright, and the possibilities are endless!</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 5: The Technical Debt Dilemma</strong></p>
<p>As I walked into the conference room at NDC 2024 London, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness. I was about to listen to a talk on technical debt, a topic that I knew all too well. The speaker, Kevin Henny, a seasoned developer and trainer, took the stage and began his presentation.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-technical-debt"><strong>The Problem with Technical Debt</strong></h2>
<p>"Technical debt is a concept that has been around for a while," Kevin started. "But I think we've been using it in a way that's not entirely accurate. We've been using it to describe a problem that's not necessarily a problem at all."</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, surveying the audience.</p>
<p>"I mean, think about it. When we talk about technical debt, we're talking about code that's not perfect, code that's not maintainable, code that's not scalable. But is that really a problem? Or is it just a normal part of the development process?"</p>
<p>The audience was silent, taken aback by Kevin's words.</p>
<p>"We've been using the term 'technical debt' to describe a feeling, a feeling that we're not doing something right. But what we're really talking about is a lack of time, a lack of resources, a lack of planning. It's not a debt, it's a symptom of a larger problem."</p>
<h2 id="the-metaphor-of-technical-debt"><strong>The Metaphor of Technical Debt</strong></h2>
<p>Kevin then went on to talk about the metaphor of technical debt, and how it's often used to describe a problem that's not necessarily a problem at all.</p>
<p>"I mean, think about it. When we talk about technical debt, we're talking about a metaphor, a metaphor that's not entirely accurate. We're talking about a debt that's owed, a debt that needs to be paid back. But what does that even mean? Is it a debt to ourselves, to our colleagues, to our customers?"</p>
<p>He paused, letting the audience absorb his words.</p>
<p>"I think we need to rethink the way we talk about technical debt. We need to stop using it as a metaphor for a problem that's not a problem at all. We need to stop using it to describe a feeling, and start using it to describe a real problem that needs to be addressed."</p>
<h2 id="the-consequences-of-technical-debt"><strong>The Consequences of Technical Debt</strong></h2>
<p>Kevin then went on to talk about the consequences of technical debt, and how it can affect a project and a team.</p>
<p>"Technical debt can lead to a lack of trust, a lack of confidence, a lack of motivation. It can lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed, of being stuck. It can lead to a feeling of being trapped, of being unable to move forward."</p>
<p>He paused, letting the audience absorb his words.</p>
<p>"And it's not just the developers who feel it. It's the whole team, the whole organization. Technical debt can lead to a lack of communication, a lack of collaboration, a lack of innovation."</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-to-technical-debt"><strong>The Solution to Technical Debt</strong></h2>
<p>Kevin then went on to talk about the solution to technical debt, and how it can be addressed.</p>
<p>"I think we need to stop using the term 'technical debt' and start using the term 'technical problem'. We need to stop using it as a metaphor and start using it to describe a real problem that needs to be addressed. We need to stop using it to describe a feeling and start using it to describe a real problem that needs to be solved."</p>
<p>He paused, letting the audience absorb his words.</p>
<p>"And we need to start using it to describe a problem that's not just limited to code. We need to start using it to describe a problem that's not just limited to technology. We need to start using it to describe a problem that's not just limited to our work. We need to start using it to describe a problem that's not just limited to our team. We need to start using it to describe a problem that's not just limited to our organization. We need to start using it to describe a problem that's not just limited to our industry. We need to start using it to describe a problem that's not just limited to our world. We need to start using it to describe a problem that's not just limited to our planet. We need to start using it to describe a problem that's not just limited to our universe. We need to start using it to describe a problem that's not just limited to our existence."</p>
<p>The audience was silent, taken aback by Kevin's words.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion_2"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>As Kevin finished his talk, the audience was left with a lot to think about. They were left with a new perspective on technical debt, a perspective that challenged the way they thought about the problem. They were left with a new perspective on the metaphor of technical debt, a perspective that challenged the way they thought about the problem. They were left with a new perspective on the consequences of technical debt, a perspective that challenged the way they thought about the problem. And they were left with a new perspective on the solution to technical debt, a perspective that challenged the way they thought about the problem.</p>
<p>As I left the conference room, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness. I was excited to start thinking about technical debt in a new way, a way that challenged my own perspective. I was nervous about the challenges that lay ahead, but I was also excited to face them head-on.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 7: "Pure Code, Impure Code, and The Interpreter Pattern"</strong></p>
<p>At the NDC 2024 London conference, Scott Vlan took the stage to talk about the importance of keeping code pure and the challenges that come with it. In his talk, "Pure Code, Impure Code, and The Interpreter Pattern", he shared his insights on how to navigate the complexities of coding and how to keep your code clean and maintainable.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-with-impure-code">The Problem with Impure Code</h3>
<p>Scott started by explaining the problem with impure code. "Impure code is code that's not pure, that's not explicit, that's not testable. It's code that's hard to understand, hard to maintain, and hard to test." He used the example of a function that updates a database and sends an email as an example of impure code. "This function does two things: it updates the database and sends an email. But what if we want to test just the database update? Or just the email sending? We can't do that with this code."</p>
<p>Scott emphasized the importance of keeping code pure. "Pure code is code that's explicit, that's testable, and that's easy to maintain. It's code that's easy to understand and that's easy to debug." He showed an example of how to refactor the impure code to make it pure. "We can create a separate function for updating the database and a separate function for sending the email. Now we can test each function independently and we can maintain each function separately."</p>
<h3 id="the-interpreter-pattern">The Interpreter Pattern</h3>
<p>Scott then introduced the Interpreter pattern, a design pattern that allows you to separate the interpretation of code from the execution of code. "The Interpreter pattern is a way to separate the interpretation of code from the execution of code. It's a way to create a layer of abstraction between the code and the execution environment."</p>
<p>He explained how the Interpreter pattern works. "The Interpreter pattern consists of an interpreter and a program. The interpreter takes the program as input and interprets it. The program is the code that needs to be executed. The interpreter executes the code by calling the program's methods."</p>
<p>Scott gave an example of how to use the Interpreter pattern. "Let's say we have a program that needs to execute a series of instructions. We can create an interpreter that takes the instructions as input and executes them. The interpreter can be a separate class that implements the Interpreter pattern."</p>
<h3 id="dependency-injection">Dependency Injection</h3>
<p>Scott then talked about dependency injection, a technique that allows you to decouple components from each other. "Dependency injection is a technique that allows you to decouple components from each other. It's a way to pass dependencies from one component to another."</p>
<p>He explained how dependency injection works. "Dependency injection works by passing dependencies from one component to another. The component that needs the dependency is not responsible for creating the dependency. Instead, the dependency is passed to the component from the outside."</p>
<p>Scott gave an example of how to use dependency injection. "Let's say we have a component that needs a database connection. We can pass the database connection to the component from the outside. The component is not responsible for creating the database connection. Instead, the database connection is passed to the component from the outside."</p>
<h3 id="conclusion_5">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Scott concluded his talk by emphasizing the importance of keeping code pure and the importance of using the Interpreter pattern and dependency injection to achieve this goal. "Pure code is code that's explicit, that's testable, and that's easy to maintain. It's code that's easy to understand and that's easy to debug. The Interpreter pattern and dependency injection are two techniques that can help us achieve pure code."</p>
<p>He also emphasized the importance of writing tests for our code. "Testing is an important part of writing good code. It's a way to ensure that our code works as expected and that it's easy to maintain."</p>
<p>Scott ended his talk by encouraging the audience to keep their code pure and to use the Interpreter pattern and dependency injection to achieve this goal. "Remember, pure code is code that's explicit, that's testable, and that's easy to maintain. It's code that's easy to understand and that's easy to debug. Keep your code pure and you'll be happy with the results."</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 7: Asynchronous Communication and Interprocess Communication at NDC 2024 London</strong></p>
<p>At NDC 2024 London, Sam Guckenheimer, a renowned expert in software development, took the stage to discuss the often-misunderstood concept of asynchronous communication and interprocess communication. With a hint of humor and a dash of technical expertise, Sam delved into the intricacies of these topics, providing a comprehensive overview for attendees.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Asynchronous Communication</strong></p>
<p>Sam began by highlighting the importance of asynchronous communication in modern software development. He emphasized that asynchronous communication is not just about the technology, but also about the people involved. "Asynchronous communication is about removing the need for people to be available at the same time," Sam explained. "It's about making sure that the communication happens, regardless of whether the recipient is available or not."</p>
<p>Sam pointed out that asynchronous communication is often misunderstood, and people tend to use the terms "asynchronous" and "non-blocking" interchangeably. However, he emphasized that these terms have different meanings. "Asynchronous communication is about the timing of the communication, while non-blocking is about the blocking of the thread," Sam clarified.</p>
<p><strong>The Reactive Manifesto</strong></p>
<p>Sam then discussed the Reactive Manifesto, a document that outlines the principles of reactive programming. He highlighted the importance of the manifesto's principles, such as the need for explicit handling of failures and the importance of decoupling. "The Reactive Manifesto is about creating systems that are more resilient and easier to maintain," Sam said.</p>
<p>Sam also touched on the concept of event-driven communication, which is a key aspect of reactive programming. He explained that event-driven communication is about handling events as they occur, rather than waiting for a response. "Event-driven communication is about processing events in real-time, rather than processing requests and responses," Sam said.</p>
<p><strong>Message Brokers and Interprocess Communication</strong></p>
<p>Sam then shifted his focus to message brokers and interprocess communication. He explained that message brokers are used to decouple systems and allow for asynchronous communication. "Message brokers are like post offices," Sam said. "They take a message and deliver it to the intended recipient, regardless of whether the recipient is available or not."</p>
<p>Sam highlighted the importance of message brokers in interprocess communication, explaining that they allow for loose coupling between systems. "Message brokers enable systems to communicate with each other without being tightly coupled," Sam said. "This makes it easier to change or replace individual systems without affecting the overall system."</p>
<p>Sam also discussed the different types of message brokers, such as RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka. He explained that each broker has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of broker depends on the specific use case.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Context</strong></p>
<p>Sam emphasized the importance of context in communication, explaining that the same word can have different meanings depending on the context. "The same word can have different meanings in different contexts," Sam said. "This is why it's important to consider the context when communicating."</p>
<p>Sam used the example of the word "async" to illustrate this point. He explained that "async" can mean different things depending on the context, such as asynchronous communication or asynchronous programming. "The same word can have different meanings, and it's important to consider the context to avoid confusion," Sam said.</p>
<p><strong>The Snowflake Liberal</strong></p>
<p>Sam then took a detour to discuss the concept of the "snowflake liberal," a term he coined to describe people who are open-minded and willing to learn. "The snowflake liberal is someone who is open to new ideas and willing to learn," Sam said. "They are not afraid to admit when they are wrong and are willing to adapt to new information."</p>
<p>Sam emphasized the importance of being a snowflake liberal in the field of software development, explaining that it is essential to be open-minded and willing to learn. "The snowflake liberal is essential in software development, where new technologies and approaches are emerging all the time," Sam said.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Sam concluded his talk by emphasizing the importance of asynchronous communication and interprocess communication in modern software development. He highlighted the need for explicit handling of failures, decoupling, and event-driven communication. He also emphasized the importance of context and being a snowflake liberal in the field of software development.</p>
<p>Sam's talk provided a comprehensive overview of the topics, and attendees left the session with a better understanding of asynchronous communication and interprocess communication. The talk was well-received, and attendees appreciated Sam's ability to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner.</p>

<h1 id="ndc-2024-london-distributed-graph-queries-with-graphql">NDC 2024 London: Distributed Graph Queries with GraphQL</h1>
<h3 id="distributed-graph-queries-with-graphql">Distributed Graph Queries with GraphQL</h3>
<p>At the NDC 2024 London conference, Michael, a member of the technical steering committee for GraphCo, took the stage to talk about distributed graph queries with GraphQL. He began by explaining that the need to discover distributed graph queries arose around 2015-2016, when he was working on a project for a Swiss insurance company to redo their entire stack. The goal was to build a new customer portal with a backend service and a mobile application. The team was tasked with designing a backend service that could serve client-side engineers.</p>
<h3 id="the-rise-of-graphql">The Rise of GraphQL</h3>
<p>In 2015, the React conference announced GraphQL, an open-source query language for APIs. This caught the attention of the frontend engineers, who were building UI components and fetching data. Suddenly, the technical complexity of getting data became a major concern. Michael explained that building a GraphQL app requires thinking about data fetching and data contracts. He emphasized that the frontend engineer's main concern is the data contract, which is built around the graph specification.</p>
<h3 id="graph-schema-and-fragment-composition">Graph Schema and Fragment Composition</h3>
<p>Michael introduced the concept of graph schema and fragment composition, which allows frontend engineers to compose data fragments and compose UI components. He showed an example of a graph schema, where a user can query for a user's data, and the graph schema can compose multiple subgraphs to fetch the required data. This approach enables efficient data fetching and reduces the number of requests to the server.</p>
<h3 id="distributed-architecture">Distributed Architecture</h3>
<p>However, as the system grew, the need for a distributed architecture became apparent. Michael explained that the original monolithic architecture was not scalable and introduced a distributed architecture using GraphQL Gateway. The Gateway acts as a single point of entry for the client and allows for the composition of multiple downstream services. This approach enables the system to handle high traffic and scale horizontally.</p>
<h3 id="schema-stitching">Schema Stitching</h3>
<p>To overcome the challenges of distributed graph queries, Michael introduced the concept of schema stitching. Schema stitching is a mechanism that allows multiple subgraphs to be composed together to form a single graph. This enables the system to resolve queries across multiple subgraphs and provides a unified API for the client. Michael showed an example of schema stitching, where multiple subgraphs are composed together to form a single graph.</p>
<h3 id="query-planning-and-execution">Query Planning and Execution</h3>
<p>Michael explained that query planning is a crucial step in distributed graph queries. The query planner determines the optimal query plan to execute, taking into account the network latency and the availability of data. He showed an example of a query plan, which is generated by the Gateway and executed across multiple subgraphs.</p>
<h3 id="real-time-data-and-telemetry">Real-time Data and Telemetry</h3>
<p>Michael emphasized the importance of real-time data and telemetry in distributed graph queries. He explained that real-time data enables the system to provide instant feedback to the client and ensures that the data is up-to-date. He also highlighted the importance of telemetry, which provides insights into the system's performance and helps optimize query planning.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion_6">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, Michael emphasized the importance of distributed graph queries in modern applications and the need for a scalable and efficient architecture. He showed how GraphQL and schema stitching can be used to compose multiple subgraphs and provide a unified API for the client. He also highlighted the importance of real-time data and telemetry in distributed graph queries.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>Q: How does schema stitching work?</p>
<p>A: Schema stitching is a mechanism that allows multiple subgraphs to be composed together to form a single graph. This enables the system to resolve queries across multiple subgraphs and provides a unified API for the client.</p>
<p>Q: How do you handle nested objects in schema stitching?</p>
<p>A: Nested objects can be handled by defining a recursive schema that composes multiple subgraphs to fetch the required data.</p>

<h1 id="ndc-2024-london-the-first-computer-program-ever-written">NDC 2024 London - The First Computer Program Ever Written</h1>
<p>As we gathered in the grand auditorium at NDC 2024 London, we were in for a treat. The speaker, a seasoned developer with a passion for history, was about to take us on a journey through the earliest days of computing. With a hint of humor and a dash of geekiness, he regaled us with the story of the first computer program ever written.</p>
<p><strong>The Birth of Computing</strong></p>
<p>Our speaker began by setting the stage for the dawn of computing. He took us back to the 1820s, when Charles Babbage, a British mathematician and inventor, envisioned a machine that could perform calculations with unprecedented speed and accuracy. This machine, known as the Difference Engine, was never built, but it laid the foundation for the development of the Analytical Engine, a more advanced machine that could perform any calculation using punched cards and a central processing unit.</p>
<p><strong>The Analytical Engine</strong></p>
<p>The Analytical Engine was a behemoth of a machine, with over 7,000 parts and weighing over 15 tons. It was designed to perform calculations using a system of gears and levers, and it could store and retrieve data using punched cards. Although it was never built during Babbage's lifetime, his vision of a machine that could perform calculations and store data set the stage for the development of modern computers.</p>
<p><strong>The First Computer Program</strong></p>
<p>Fast forward to the 1840s, when Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron and a mathematician in her own right, became fascinated with Babbage's work. She translated an article on the Analytical Engine by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea, and in the process, she wrote her own notes on the machine. Her notes were extensive and included what is considered to be the first computer program ever written.</p>
<p><strong>The Program</strong></p>
<p>The program was written in a notation system that Ada Lovelace developed, which was based on the Analytical Engine's instructions. The program was designed to calculate Bernoulli numbers, a sequence of numbers that had been studied by mathematicians for centuries. The program was remarkable not only for its complexity but also for its elegance and beauty.</p>
<p><strong>The Calculation</strong></p>
<p>The program was run on the Analytical Engine using punched cards, which were inserted into the machine's card reader. The machine performed the calculations, and the results were stored in a memory register. The program was designed to calculate the Bernoulli numbers up to the 97th iteration, a feat that would have taken a human mathematician years to accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>The Legacy</strong></p>
<p>Ada Lovelace's program was a groundbreaking achievement that marked the beginning of the computer age. It demonstrated the potential of machines to perform calculations and store data, and it paved the way for the development of modern computers. Her work on the Analytical Engine also laid the foundation for the development of programming languages, which would become a crucial part of computer science.</p>
<p><strong>The Babbage Legacy</strong></p>
<p>Charles Babbage's legacy extends far beyond his work on the Analytical Engine. He is considered the father of the computer, and his vision of a machine that could perform calculations and store data has had a profound impact on modern society. His work on the Analytical Engine also influenced the development of modern programming languages, including COBOL and Fortran.</p>
<p><strong>The Ada Lovelace Legacy</strong></p>
<p>Ada Lovelace's legacy is equally impressive. She is considered the first computer programmer, and her work on the Analytical Engine's program demonstrated the potential of machines to perform complex calculations. Her notes on the Analytical Engine also provide a unique insight into the development of the machine and its capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As we concluded our journey through the early days of computing, we were reminded of the power of innovation and the importance of preserving our history. The story of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace is a testament to the power of human ingenuity and the potential of machines to transform our world. As we look to the future of computing, we would do well to remember the pioneers who paved the way for us.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 4: Richard Campbell's Keynote at NDC 2024 London</strong></p>
<p>At the 2024 NDC London conference, Richard Campbell took the stage to deliver a keynote speech that would leave the audience in awe. With over 20 years of experience in the tech industry, Richard has seen it all - from the early days of .NET to the rise of cross-platform development. His keynote, titled "The Evolution of .NET and the Future of Development," was a journey through the history of .NET, highlighting the key milestones and challenges that shaped the platform.</p>
<p><strong>The Early Days of .NET</strong></p>
<p>Richard began by taking the audience on a trip down memory lane, reminiscing about the early days of .NET. "I joined Microsoft in 2002, and it was an exciting time," he said. "We were building a new platform, and everyone was talking about it." He recalled the first PDC conference in 2002, where they announced the first version of .NET, and how it was met with skepticism at first. "People were saying, 'This is just a bunch of hype, it'll never take off.' But we were convinced that it would change the world."</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Cross-Platform Development</strong></p>
<p>Fast-forward to the present, and Richard highlighted the significant shift towards cross-platform development. "In the early 2000s, we were all about building Windows-based applications. But as the world became more mobile, we realized that we needed to adapt." He spoke about the challenges they faced in creating a cross-platform framework that would work seamlessly across multiple devices and operating systems. "It was a tough journey, but we learned a lot along the way."</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Open Source</strong></p>
<p>Richard emphasized the importance of open source in the development community. "Open source has been a game-changer for us. It allows us to build a community around our platform, and get feedback from developers who are passionate about what we're doing." He mentioned the success of projects like Mono, which allowed developers to run .NET applications on non-Windows platforms. "Mono was a huge success, and it showed us that we could build a community around our platform, even if it wasn't just for Windows."</p>
<p><strong>The Future of .NET</strong></p>
<p>Looking to the future, Richard discussed the current state of .NET, and the challenges that lie ahead. "We're still working on making .NET a cross-platform framework that works seamlessly across multiple devices and operating systems." He highlighted the recent release of .NET 6, which marked a significant milestone in their journey towards a unified platform. "NET 6 is a major release, and it's the culmination of all our hard work over the past few years."</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Cloud Computing</strong></p>
<p>Richard also touched on the rise of cloud computing and its impact on the development community. "Cloud has changed everything. It's allowed us to build applications that can scale to millions of users, and that can be deployed instantly. It's a game-changer for developers, and it's something that we're embracing wholeheartedly."</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As Richard wrapped up his keynote, he reflected on the journey of .NET and the lessons they've learned along the way. "It's been a wild ride, but we're proud of what we've accomplished. We're excited about the future, and we're committed to making .NET a platform that developers love to use." The audience applauded as Richard left the stage, leaving behind a lasting impression of the evolution of .NET and the future of development.</p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A Session</strong></p>
<p>After the keynote, Richard answered questions from the audience, covering topics such as the future of cross-platform development, the role of open source in the development community, and the challenges of building a unified platform. He also shared some personal anecdotes and insights from his time at Microsoft, providing a unique perspective on the evolution of the company and the tech industry as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>
<p>Richard's keynote at NDC 2024 London was a thought-provoking and entertaining look at the evolution of .NET and the future of development. The audience was left with a renewed sense of excitement and optimism about the possibilities that .NET offers, and the potential for developers to build innovative applications that can change the world.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 7: "The Principles of Visual Design" - A Keynote by [Speaker's Name] at NDC 2024 London</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>At NDC 2024 London, attendees were treated to a thought-provoking keynote by [Speaker's Name], a renowned expert in the field of visual design. In this chapter, we will dive into the key takeaways from the keynote, focusing on the principles of visual design and how they can be applied to create a better user experience.</p>
<p><strong>The Principles of Visual Design</strong></p>
<p>The keynote began with a discussion on the principles of visual design, which are the foundation of creating effective and user-friendly interfaces. The speaker emphasized that visual design is not just about making things look pretty, but rather about creating a system that works for the user.</p>
<p><strong>Attentional Blindness</strong></p>
<p>The first principle discussed was attentional blindness, which refers to the tendency for our brains to filter out visual information that is not relevant to our attention. The speaker showed a famous video demonstrating attentional blindness, where a person is walking down a street and a person in a gorilla costume walks through the scene, and most viewers do not notice the gorilla.</p>
<p>The speaker explained that this is because our brains are wired to focus on the task at hand and ignore irrelevant information. This principle has significant implications for visual design, as it highlights the importance of making relevant information stand out and reducing visual clutter.</p>
<p><strong>The Gestalt Principle</strong></p>
<p>The next principle discussed was the Gestalt principle, which states that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The speaker explained that this principle is based on the idea that our brains group similar elements together to create a meaningful whole. This is why, for example, when we see a group of objects that are similar in shape and color, we tend to perceive them as a single entity rather than individual objects.</p>
<p>The speaker showed examples of how the Gestalt principle can be applied in visual design, such as using similar shapes and colors to group related elements together, and creating a sense of continuity between elements.</p>
<p><strong>Proximity and Similarity</strong></p>
<p>The speaker also discussed the principles of proximity and similarity, which are closely related to the Gestalt principle. Proximity refers to the physical distance between elements, and similarity refers to the degree to which elements are similar in shape, color, or other visual characteristics.</p>
<p>The speaker explained that when elements are close together, our brains tend to group them together, and when elements are similar, our brains tend to perceive them as part of the same category. This has significant implications for visual design, as it highlights the importance of arranging elements in a way that creates a clear visual hierarchy and grouping similar elements together.</p>
<p><strong>Archetype and Pattern</strong></p>
<p>The speaker also discussed the concepts of archetype and pattern, which are important principles in visual design. An archetype is a fundamental pattern or design element that is common to a particular category of objects or experiences, such as a door or a button. A pattern is a repeated design element that creates a sense of rhythm or unity.</p>
<p>The speaker explained that using archetypes and patterns in visual design can help to create a sense of familiarity and consistency, which can make the design more intuitive and user-friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Principle of Continuity</strong></p>
<p>The speaker also discussed the principle of continuity, which states that our brains tend to perceive continuous patterns and shapes rather than disjointed or fragmented ones. The speaker showed examples of how this principle can be applied in visual design, such as using lines or shapes to create a sense of continuity between elements.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, the keynote by [Speaker's Name] provided a comprehensive overview of the principles of visual design, including attentional blindness, the Gestalt principle, proximity and similarity, archetype and pattern, and the principle of continuity. By applying these principles, designers can create visual designs that are intuitive, user-friendly, and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

first time seeing one talk, feel free send email afterwards, ask question, might have forgotten, put email slide, thought I super clear, everything I covered, know question afterwards, feel free send email, Graide, hallway going talking, everything C and .NET language, net runtime framework, changed, would like upgrade, latest version, net, anyone using .NET Framework, oh half anyone still using .NET Framework, many time upgrade, I know sound easier, um, lot customer work .NET Framework, trying get reason jump new net, I still want call framework, get confusing there, lot good reason, want jump net, especially net 8, going try cover, thing there, tie cloud feature, added C, going cover new one, Im listing well start, net 8, latest version, net, whats changed, there helper work date time, there improvement, system text Json, there lot performance improvement, there many thing going covering today, whats interesting with .NET follow specific release cycle, every year, new version, November, always release new version, net, least that's case, past year, November, released net 8, latest version, longtime support, version, mean going support, 36 months, quite long time, youre .NET 7, anyone .NET 7, still know support .NET 7, end May, year, good time, actually upgrade, doesn't mean going work, anymore, mean there going support, fix, update, might well, upgrade, idea super simple, go net 5, 6, 7, new version, toggle switch, project, file, rebuild, application, everything work, ever happen, probably Microsoft, really good track record, backwards compatible, that's true, type application, youre example, net Maui, Blazer UI, tied application, really true, get little bit tricky, especially dependency, project, well, I guess idea always build anything net, that's even true, latest version, net, finally there, I would say, complete support, building cross-platform, mobile apps, story, totally different, talk, use Maui, build application, Fort, net, uh, iOS, Android, Mac OS, window, one platform, idea still able, build anything net, even though initially, idea .NET Framework, anyone .NET developer, started, net, one example, .NET Framework, one know, idea

performance improvement, Im going talking, lot internally, tip, trick, use application, Ive said, performance, performance, performance, Im going jump around, like Steve Balmer, screaming on stage, really important aspect, net, upgrade, Net 5, net 8, you've tremendous amount, performance, fix, also including, le allocation, optimized code path, everythings going run, faster, they've done, they've introduced, improvement, language, well, runtime, gradually, add internal, component, make everything, faster, idea, toggle net 8, rebuild, application, make use, new performance improvement, they've also introduced, whats known, time abstraction, making testing, better, youre using date time, example, well, look moment, lot improvement, system text Json, anyone using, newtonsoft Json, Json net, oh wow, almost using Json net, anyone using, system text Json, many that's great, idea never system text adjacent, replace, Newton soft Json, even though, Microsoft, hired guy, built Newton soft Json, still maintained, good out-of-the-box experience, net, focus, performance, meant, exactly, Newton soft Json, Newton soft Json, work, Json, document, aren't, super well, formatted, uh, forgiving, Json, data, parse, also, mean, performant, could, built, UTF8, string, literal, name, c 11, feature, allows, use, UTF8, string, directly, language, constant, string, someone probably, asking, wouldnt want, everything web, UTF16, making, conversion, UTF8, UTF16, little bit, time-consuming, like, couple CPU cycles, require, extra memory, allocation, able, Define, using, UTF ring, lit, roll, memory, Im locating, space, middle, slicing, everything, start, first, space, grabbing, second, name, well, putting, second, span, doesn't, extra memory, allocation, term, working, array,

<p><strong>NDC 2024 London: A Look Back</strong></p>
<p>The NDC 2024 London conference was a thrilling event that brought together some of the brightest minds in the tech industry. One of the most talked-about sessions was Kevin Pilch's talk on "Building Resilient and Scalable Distributed Systems with Cosmos DB". In this chapter, we'll dive into the transcript of his talk and explore the key takeaways.</p>
<p><strong>Building Resilient and Scalable Distributed Systems with Cosmos DB</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kevin Pilch</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB Team</p>
<hr />
<p>Hello everyone, I'm Kevin Pilch, and I work on the Azure Cosmos DB team. I've been at Microsoft for 21 years, and I spent the first 20 years working on the .NET language runtime, tooling, and Visual Studio. I'm now an engineer manager, and I manage a team of 30 people.</p>
<p>Last year, I decided to switch to the Cosmos DB team, and it's been a fantastic experience. I'm excited to be here today to talk about building resilient and scalable distributed systems with Cosmos DB.</p>
<p><strong>A Brief History of Cosmos DB</strong></p>
<p>Cosmos DB was started in 2010 by a Microsoft technical fellow, Dharma Shukla. It was initially codenamed "Project Florence" internally. By 2014, it was already powering critical services within Azure and Microsoft. We launched publicly in 2017 and added multi-API support for Gremlin and Cassandra in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>The Anatomy of a Cosmos DB Request</strong></p>
<p>Let's take a look at the anatomy of a Cosmos DB request. We have the API Gateway, which is responsible for routing requests to the correct backend node. We have the backend nodes, which are responsible for storing and retrieving data. We have the storage engine, which is responsible for storing the data. And we have the replication engine, which is responsible for replicating the data across different regions and fault domains.</p>
<p><strong>Replication and Consistency</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to replication and consistency, Cosmos DB uses a quorum-based protocol. This means that we require a certain number of nodes to agree on the state of the data before considering it committed. This provides strong consistency and durability.</p>
<p>However, this comes at the cost of higher latency and lower availability. To mitigate this, we offer a variety of consistency models, including strong consistency, bounded staleness, and session consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Elasticity and Autoscaling</strong></p>
<p>Cosmos DB is designed to be highly elastic and autoscaling. We use a container-based architecture, which allows us to easily add or remove containers as needed. We also use a resource governance system, which allows us to monitor and control resource usage.</p>
<p><strong>Autoscaling with Azure DevOps</strong></p>
<p>We use Azure DevOps to automate our testing and deployment pipeline. We run performance tests every time we check in code, and we use a canary deployment strategy to ensure that our changes don't affect our users.</p>
<p><strong>Load Balancing and Partitioning</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to load balancing and partitioning, we use a combination of Azure Load Balancer and Azure Traffic Manager. We also use a custom-built load balancer that allows us to route traffic to the correct partition.</p>
<p><strong>Query Optimization</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to query optimization, we use a variety of techniques, including caching, indexing, and query optimization. We also use a query optimizer that can re-arrange the query plan to minimize the number of trips to the storage engine.</p>
<p><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to conflict resolution, we use a variety of techniques, including optimistic concurrency and pessimistic concurrency. We also use a conflict resolution algorithm that can detect and resolve conflicts automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Building resilient and scalable distributed systems with Cosmos DB requires careful planning and execution. We've covered a lot of ground today, from the anatomy of a Cosmos DB request to conflict resolution. I hope you've learned something new and valuable today. Thank you for your attention, and I welcome any questions you may have.</p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<p>Q: Can you explain more about the conflict resolution algorithm?</p>
<p>A: Sure! Our conflict resolution algorithm is based on a combination of optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control. We use a version vector to track the version of the data, and we use a timestamp to determine the order of the updates.</p>
<p>Q: Can you explain more about the query optimization algorithm?</p>
<p>A: Sure! Our query optimization algorithm is based on a combination of caching, indexing, and query rewriting. We use a query plan that minimizes the number of trips to the storage engine, and we use a cost-based optimizer that chooses the most efficient query plan.</p>
<p>Q: Can you explain more about the Azure DevOps pipeline?</p>
<p>A: Sure! We use a combination of Azure Pipelines and Azure DevOps to automate our testing and deployment pipeline. We run performance tests every time we check in code, and we use a canary deployment strategy to ensure that our changes don't affect our users.</p>
<p>Q: Can you explain more about the Cosmos DB SDK?</p>
<p>A: Sure! Our Cosmos DB SDK is a set of libraries that allow developers to interact with Cosmos DB programmatically. It's available for a variety of languages, including .NET, Java, Python, and Go.</p>
<hr />
<p>I hope this chapter has given you a good understanding of the key takeaways from Kevin Pilch's talk on "Building Resilient and Scalable Distributed Systems with Cosmos DB". From the anatomy of a Cosmos DB request to conflict resolution, we've covered a lot of ground. I hope you've learned something new and valuable today.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 7: "The Journey to a Greener Future: A Story of Sustainability and Innovation"</strong></p>
<p>At the 2024 NDC conference in London, I had the privilege of hearing a fascinating talk by La Im, a software engineer from a London-based startup, Fund UPS. La Im shared a real-life story of how their company tackled the challenge of building a sustainable future, not just for their business but also for the environment. In this chapter, I'll summarize the key takeaways from La Im's talk, highlighting the importance of sustainability, innovation, and the power of data.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>La Im started by sharing the story of Fund UPS, a startup that began by signing clients and attracting bigger names. However, as the company grew, they faced a major challenge: building a sustainable future for their business and the environment. La Im explained that this was no small feat, as the company had to balance the needs of their clients with the need to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
<p><strong>The Journey Begins</strong></p>
<p>La Im explained that the journey to sustainability began with a realization that their current infrastructure was not sustainable. They were using a monolithic architecture, which made it difficult to scale and maintain. They also had to deal with noisy neighboring issues, where one client's workload would impact the performance of another client's system. This was not only a technical challenge but also a business risk, as it could lead to lost revenue and reputation damage.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>La Im and his team decided to take a bold step and rebuild their infrastructure using a cloud-native architecture. They chose AWS as their cloud provider, which allowed them to take advantage of scalable and on-demand computing resources. They also implemented a distributed computing model, which enabled them to scale their workload more efficiently and reduce the risk of noisy neighboring issues.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits</strong></p>
<p>The benefits of this new infrastructure were numerous. La Im explained that they were able to reduce their electricity usage by 70% and their carbon footprint by 90%. They also reduced their maintenance costs by 80%, as they no longer had to worry about patching and upgrading their own infrastructure. Most importantly, they were able to reduce their response time to clients, which improved their overall customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Data</strong></p>
<p>La Im emphasized the importance of data in their journey to sustainability. They used data to track their carbon footprint and identify areas for improvement. They also used data to optimize their infrastructure and reduce waste. For example, they used data to identify which clients were using the most resources and optimized their workload accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>The Future of Sustainability</strong></p>
<p>La Im concluded his talk by highlighting the importance of sustainability in the future of software engineering.

<p><strong>Chapter 7: NDC 2024 London - Michelle Frost's Keynote on Addressing Bias in Machine Learning</strong></p>
<p>At the NDC 2024 London conference, Michelle Frost, Senior Developer at Crema Software Consultancy and a graduate student at Johns Hopkins, delivered a thought-provoking keynote on addressing bias in machine learning. Her presentation, titled "Addressing Bias in Machine Learning: A Discussion on Society, Machine Learning, and the Life Cycle," covered the importance of understanding and mitigating bias in AI systems.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Understanding Bias</strong></p>
<p>Michelle began by emphasizing the significance of understanding bias in machine learning. "I'm here today to talk about bias in machine learning. Bias is a term that's thrown around a lot, but I think it's important to define what we mean by bias. Bias is not just about being unfair or discriminatory; it's about the systematic error that occurs when a model is trained on a biased dataset." She highlighted that bias can occur at every stage of the machine learning life cycle, from data generation to deployment.</p>
<p><strong>The Life Cycle of Machine Learning</strong></p>
<p>Michelle explained that understanding the life cycle of machine learning is crucial in identifying potential sources of bias. She outlined the seven places where bias can be injected into the system:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Generation</strong>: "Historical bias" can occur during data generation, where data is often collected with biases towards certain groups or demographics.</li>
<li><strong>Data Aggregation</strong>: "Aggregation bias" can occur when data is aggregated from different sources, leading to biased representations of certain groups.</li>
<li><strong>Model Building</strong>: "Learning bias" can occur during model building, where assumptions are made about the data and the model is trained on biased data.</li>
<li><strong>Model Implementation</strong>: "Implementation bias" can occur when the model is implemented, and the context is not taken into account.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: "Evaluation bias" can occur during evaluation, where the model is tested on biased data or with biased metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: "Deployment bias" can occur when the model is deployed, and the context is not taken into account.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Bias</strong>: "Historical bias" can occur when the model is used, and the context is not taken into account.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Impact of Bias</strong></p>
<p>Michelle emphasized the impact of bias on machine learning models. "When we build biased models, we are perpetuating harm. We are creating systems that are not fair and just, and that can have significant consequences." She highlighted examples of biased AI systems, including Amazon's AI hiring tool, which was found to be biased against women, and the COMPAS algorithm, which was found to be biased against African Americans.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigating Bias</strong></p>
<p>Michelle discussed various techniques for mitigating bias in machine learning models. She emphasized the importance of:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preprocessing</strong>: "Preprocessing is key. We need to make sure that our data is clean, and that we're not introducing bias during the preprocessing stage."</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Techniques</strong>: "There are several mitigation techniques we can use, such as debiasing, data augmentation, and adversarial training."</li>
<li><strong>Postprocessing</strong>: "Postprocessing is also important. We need to make sure that our model is not introducing bias during the evaluation stage."</li>
<li><strong>Fairness Metrics</strong>: "We need to use fairness metrics to evaluate our models. We can't just rely on accuracy metrics; we need to consider fairness metrics as well."</li>
<li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop</strong>: "Human-in-the-loop is crucial. We need to involve humans in the machine learning process to ensure that our models are fair and just."</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Michelle concluded her keynote by emphasizing the importance of understanding and mitigating bias in machine learning. "Bias is not just a technical issue; it's a societal issue. We need to take a holistic approach to addressing bias in machine learning, and we need to involve humans in the process. We can't just rely on algorithms to fix the problem; we need to use our human judgment and expertise to ensure that our models are fair and just."</p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A Session</strong></p>
<p>The Q&amp;A session that followed was lively and engaging, with attendees asking questions about the importance of understanding bias, the impact of bias on machine learning models, and the techniques for mitigating bias. Michelle's keynote set the tone for the rest of the conference, emphasizing the importance of fairness and ethics in machine learning.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>
<p>For those interested in learning more about addressing bias in machine learning, Michelle recommended the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virginia Eubanks' book "Automating Inequality"</li>
<li>The "Responsible AI Toolkit" by Microsoft</li>
<li>The "Fairness dashboard" by IBM</li>
<li>The "Equalized Odds" metric</li>
<li>The "Counterfactual" approach to fairness</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Michelle's keynote on addressing bias in machine learning was a thought-provoking and informative session that emphasized the importance of understanding and mitigating bias in AI systems. Her discussion on the life cycle of machine learning and the techniques for mitigating bias provided valuable insights for attendees, and her emphasis on the importance of fairness and ethics in machine learning set the tone for the rest of the conference.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 12: Two-Factor Authentication - The Fast and Furious Approach</strong></p>
<p>At NDC 2024 London, the topic of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) was a hot topic of discussion. Nathaniel Okena, a developer evangelist at twio, took the stage to share his insights on the importance of 2FA and how it can be implemented in a way that is both secure and user-friendly.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem with SMS-based 2FA</strong></p>
<p>Nathaniel started by highlighting the limitations of SMS-based 2FA. "We've all been there," he said. "You're trying to log into your account, and you receive a SMS with a code to verify your identity. But what happens when that SMS doesn't arrive? Or what if you're in a country where SMS traffic is heavy, and you're stuck waiting for what feels like an eternity for that code to arrive?"</p>
<p>Nathaniel pointed out that SMS-based 2FA is not a reliable solution. "We've all experienced it - the frustration of waiting for that SMS to arrive, only to realize that it's never coming. It's like trying to start a car with a faulty ignition - it just won't work."</p>
<p><strong>The Need for a Better Solution</strong></p>
<p>So, what's the alternative? Nathaniel believes that the answer lies in using a more secure and reliable form of 2FA. "We need to move away from SMS-based 2FA and towards more secure methods that don't rely on SMS traffic. We need a solution that is transparent, reliable, and easy to use."</p>
<p><strong>The Solution: twio's Verify</strong></p>
<p>twio's Verify is a 2FA solution that uses a combination of SMS and other verification methods to provide a more secure and reliable way to authenticate users. "With twio's Verify, you can send a verification code via SMS, but you can also use other methods like WhatsApp, email, or even a one-time password," Nathaniel explained. "And if the user is unable to receive the code, you can retry sending it, or even switch to a different method altogether."</p>
<p>Nathaniel demonstrated how twio's Verify works, showing how users can be prompted to enter a verification code, and how the system can automatically retry sending the code if it's not received. "It's like having a backup plan in case something goes wrong," he said.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits of twio's Verify</strong></p>
<p>So, what are the benefits of using twio's Verify? Nathaniel highlighted several key advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: twio's Verify uses a combination of SMS and other verification methods to provide a more secure way to authenticate users.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: With twio's Verify, you can retry sending a verification code if it's not received, or switch to a different method altogether.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of use</strong>: twio's Verify is easy to use, and users can be prompted to enter a verification code in a way that is transparent and easy to understand.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: twio's Verify provides a clear and transparent way to authenticate users, making it easier to track and manage user authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Future of 2FA</strong></p>
<p>As Nathaniel wrapped up his talk, he looked to the future of 2FA. "We're moving towards a world where 2FA is the norm, and where users expect a more secure and reliable way to authenticate online," he said. "We need to be prepared to adapt to changing user expectations and to provide solutions that meet those expectations. With twio's Verify, we're one step closer to making that a reality."</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, Nathaniel's talk highlighted the importance of moving away from SMS-based 2FA and towards more secure and reliable methods. twio's Verify is a solution that provides a combination of SMS and other verification methods to provide a more secure and reliable way to authenticate users. By using twio's Verify, developers can provide a better user experience, improve security, and reduce the risk of fraud and identity theft. As the future of 2FA continues to evolve, it's clear that solutions like twio's Verify will play a key role in shaping the way we authenticate online.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 4: Git: The Magic Sauce</strong></p>
<p>At NDC 2024 London, one of the most popular talks was on Git, the popular version control system. The speaker, Rob Rich, took the audience on a deep dive into the world of Git, sharing his insights and experiences with the technology. In this chapter, we'll explore the transcript of the talk, highlighting the key points and takeaways.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Git</strong></p>
<p>Rob started by highlighting the power of Git, noting that it's a "magic sauce" that makes it easy to manage code. He explained that Git is a distributed version control system, which means that it allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously. This is achieved through the concept of "commits," which are snapshots of the code at a particular point in time.</p>
<p>Rob demonstrated how to create a new Git repository, explaining that it's a simple process that involves initializing a new directory and running the <code>git init</code> command. He also showed how to add a file to the repository, using the <code>git add</code> command, and how to commit the changes using the <code>git commit</code> command.</p>
<p><strong>Git Hooks</strong></p>
<p>One of the key features of Git is the concept of "hooks," which are small scripts that can be run at various points during the Git workflow. Rob explained that hooks can be used to automate tasks, such as formatting code or running tests. He demonstrated how to create a hook using the <code>git hook</code> command, and showed how to use it to automatically format code.</p>
<p>Rob also discussed the different types of hooks available, including pre-commit hooks, post-commit hooks, and post-receive hooks. He explained that pre-commit hooks are run before a commit is made, while post-commit hooks are run after a commit is made. Post-receive hooks, on the other hand, are run when a repository is pushed to a remote server.</p>
<p><strong>Git Index</strong></p>
<p>Rob then turned his attention to the Git index, which is a critical component of the Git workflow. He explained that the index is a cache of the changes made to the code, and that it's used to speed up the commit process. He demonstrated how to use the <code>git add</code> command to stage changes, and how to use the <code>git status</code> command to view the status of the index.</p>
<p>Rob also discussed the concept of "stashing" changes, which allows developers to temporarily set aside changes without committing them. He explained that stashing is a useful feature when working on complex code changes, as it allows developers to quickly switch between different versions of the code.</p>
<p><strong>Git Remotes</strong></p>
<p>Rob then turned his attention to Git remotes, which are repositories that are stored on a remote server. He explained that remotes are used to share code between different developers, and that they can be used to track changes made to the code. He demonstrated how to create a remote repository using the <code>git init</code> command, and how to push changes to the remote repository using the <code>git push</code> command.</p>
<p>Rob also discussed the concept of "fetching" changes from a remote repository, which allows developers to retrieve changes made by others. He explained that fetching is a useful feature when working on a team, as it allows developers to stay up-to-date with the latest changes.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, Rob's talk on Git was a comprehensive overview of the technology, covering everything from the basics of creating a new repository to the more advanced topics of hooks and remotes. He demonstrated how to use Git to manage code, and how to use it to collaborate with others. He also highlighted the key features of Git, including its distributed nature, its ability to track changes, and its support for hooks and remotes.</p>
<p>Throughout the talk, Rob emphasized the importance of understanding the underlying mechanics of Git, and how it can be used to improve the development process. He encouraged the audience to explore the world of Git, and to use it to take their code to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>
<p>Here are some key takeaways from Rob's talk on Git:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git is a powerful version control system that makes it easy to manage code.</li>
<li>Git is a distributed system, which means that it allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously.</li>

<h1 id="ndc-2024-london-the-marble-of-complexity-by-hani">NDC 2024 London: "The Marble of Complexity" by Hani</h1>
<p>At the 2024 London edition of the Nordic Developer Conference (NDC), Hani took to the stage to deliver a thought-provoking talk titled "The Marble of Complexity". As the title suggests, Hani's presentation delved into the intricacies of software development, exploring the challenges and opportunities that arise when dealing with complexity.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-of-complexity">The Problem of Complexity</h3>
<p>Hani began by acknowledging the elephant in the room: complexity. "We've all been there," he said, "where we're working on a project, and suddenly, it becomes a mess. We're dealing with multiple dependencies, multiple layers, and multiple moving parts." He emphasized that complexity is not just a problem, but a fundamental aspect of software development.</p>
<h3 id="the-lego-marble-analogy">The Lego Marble Analogy</h3>
<p>To illustrate his point, Hani introduced the concept of the Lego marble. "Imagine you're building a Lego castle," he said. "You start with a simple foundation, and then you add more and more details. But as you do, the complexity grows. You start to wonder, 'How do I keep track of all these pieces? How do I ensure that everything fits together?' That's what I call the marble of complexity."</p>
<p>Hani argued that, just like a Lego marble, software systems can become incredibly complex, making it challenging to manage and maintain. He cited the example of a microservices architecture, where each service has its own dependencies, its own complexity, and its own set of moving parts.</p>
<h3 id="the-onion-architecture">The Onion Architecture</h3>
<p>To tackle this complexity, Hani introduced the concept of the onion architecture. "The onion architecture is a way of separating concerns," he explained. "It's a way of breaking down a system into layers, each with its own responsibilities. This allows us to focus on one layer at a time, rather than getting overwhelmed by the entire system."</p>
<p>Hani emphasized that the onion architecture is not a silver bullet, but rather a tool to help manage complexity. "It's not a magic solution," he said. "It's a way of thinking about how to structure our code, how to separate concerns, and how to make it easier to maintain."</p>
<h3 id="the-importance-of-plugins">The Importance of Plugins</h3>
<p>Another key concept Hani discussed was the importance of plugins. "Plugins are a way of extending the core functionality of our system," he said. "They allow us to add new features, new functionality, and new complexity, without having to rewrite the entire system."</p>
<p>Hani highlighted the benefits of using plugins, including the ability to decouple dependencies, to reuse code, and to make it easier to maintain and extend the system.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenges-of-plugins">The Challenges of Plugins</h3>
<p>However, Hani also acknowledged the challenges of using plugins. "Plugins can introduce new complexity," he said. "They can introduce new dependencies, new layers, and new moving parts. They can make it harder to maintain and extend the system."</p>
<p>To address these challenges, Hani emphasized the importance of careful planning, careful design, and careful implementation. "We need to think carefully about how we structure our plugins, how we separate concerns, and how we make it easy to maintain and extend the system."</p>
<h3 id="the-1010-rule">The 10/10 Rule</h3>
<p>Hani concluded his talk by introducing the 10/10 rule. "The 10/10 rule states that if you're working on a feature, and you're not sure whether to keep it or not, you should throw it away," he said. "If you're not sure whether it's worth the effort, you should throw it away. This rule helps us prioritize, it helps us focus on the most important things, and it helps us avoid getting bogged down in unnecessary complexity."</p>
<p>Hani emphasized that the 10/10 rule is not just a rule, but a mindset. "It's a way of thinking about how we approach software development, how we prioritize our work, and how we make it easier to maintain and extend our systems."</p>
<p>In conclusion, Hani's talk on "The Marble of Complexity" was a thought-provoking exploration of the challenges and opportunities that arise when dealing with complexity in software development. By introducing the concepts of the Lego marble, the onion architecture, and the importance of plugins, Hani provided a nuanced and actionable perspective on how to manage complexity and build more maintainable systems.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 4: NDC 2024 London - Modernization and Architecture</strong></p>
<p>At the NDC 2024 London conference, one of the most thought-provoking talks was on the topic of modernization and architecture. The speaker, a seasoned expert in the field, shared his insights and experiences on how to approach modernization and build a successful architecture. This chapter summarizes the key points from the talk, highlighting the importance of understanding business goals, identifying key components, and adopting a modernization mindset.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Business Goals</strong></p>
<p>The speaker emphasized the importance of understanding the business goals and objectives before embarking on a modernization journey. He stressed that it's crucial to have a clear understanding of the company's vision, mission, and values. This will help ensure that the modernization effort is aligned with the company's overall strategy and goals.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the speaker recommended conducting workshops and gathering input from different stakeholders, including business leaders, developers, and users. This will help identify the key components and subdomains that need to be modernized, as well as the business goals and objectives that need to be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Key Components</strong></p>
<p>The speaker also highlighted the importance of identifying the key components and subdomains that need to be modernized. He emphasized that this is a crucial step in the modernization process, as it will help ensure that the effort is focused on the right areas.</p>
<p>To identify these components, the speaker recommended using techniques such as event storming and C4 diagrams. Event storming is a collaborative approach that involves gathering a group of stakeholders and asking them to identify the key events and processes that occur in the system. C4 diagrams, on the other hand, are a visual representation of the system's architecture, showing the components and subdomains that make up the system.</p>
<p><strong>Adopting a Modernization Mindset</strong></p>
<p>The speaker emphasized the importance of adopting a modernization mindset, which involves embracing change and being open to new ideas and approaches. He stressed that modernization is not just about upgrading technology, but about transforming the way the company operates and approaches its business.</p>
<p>To adopt this mindset, the speaker recommended creating a culture of continuous learning and experimentation. This involves encouraging a culture of experimentation, where teams are empowered to try new things and learn from their mistakes. It also involves embracing failure, and using it as an opportunity to learn and improve.</p>
<p><strong>The Strangler Fig Pattern</strong></p>
<p>The speaker also discussed the Strangler Fig pattern, which is a common problem that occurs during modernization. The Strangler Fig pattern occurs when a new system is built alongside an old system, but the old system is not fully retired. This can lead to a situation where the new system is not fully utilized, and the old system is still being maintained.</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, the speaker recommended using a gradual approach to modernization, where the new system is built incrementally and the old system is gradually phased out. This involves identifying the key components and subdomains that need to be modernized, and building the new system in small, incremental steps.</p>
<p><strong>C4 Diagrams</strong></p>
<p>The speaker also discussed C4 diagrams, which are a visual representation of the system's architecture. C4 diagrams show the components and subdomains that make up the system, as well as the relationships between them. They are a powerful tool for understanding the system's architecture and identifying areas for improvement.</p>
<p>The speaker emphasized the importance of using C4 diagrams to visualize the system's architecture, and to identify areas for improvement. He stressed that C4 diagrams are a valuable tool for communication, and can help to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, the speaker emphasized the importance of understanding business goals, identifying key components, and adopting a modernization mindset. He stressed that modernization is not just about upgrading technology, but about transforming the way the company operates and approaches its business.</p>
<p>The speaker also emphasized the importance of using techniques such as event storming and C4 diagrams to identify the key components and subdomains that need to be modernized. He stressed that these techniques are valuable tools for communication, and can help to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.</p>
<p>Finally, the speaker emphasized the importance of adopting a gradual approach to modernization, and of using a modernization mindset to drive the effort. By following these principles, companies can successfully modernize their systems and achieve their business goals.</p>

Jody Burell, a developer advocate at JetBrains, will take us on a journey through the evolution of generative AI models, from their early beginnings to their current state-of-the-art applications. We'll examine the challenges, limitations, and potential of these models, as well as the impact they may have on our daily lives.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Journey of Generative AI Models</strong></p>
<p>Generative AI models have been making waves in the tech industry, with promises of revolutionizing the way we live and work. But what are they, and how did they get to this point? Let's start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Generative AI models are a type of artificial intelligence that can generate new, original content, such as images, music, text, or even entire videos. They're trained on vast amounts of data and learn to recognize patterns and relationships within that data. This allows them to create new content that's similar to the input data, but not necessarily identical.</p>
<p>The first generative AI models emerged in the 1980s, with the development of neural networks. These early models were simple, limited, and often produced nonsensical output. However, they paved the way for the more sophisticated models we see today.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Large Language Models</strong></p>
<p>One of the most significant milestones in the development of generative AI models was the creation of large language models. These models are trained on massive amounts of text data and can generate human-like language. They're the foundation for many modern applications, including chatbots, language translation, and text summarization.</p>
<p>The first large language model, GPT-1, was released in 2018. It was a game-changer, demonstrating the potential of generative AI models to generate coherent, readable text. Since then, subsequent models like GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4 have pushed the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
<p><strong>The Hype and the Reality</strong></p>
<p>As generative AI models have gained popularity, so has the hype surrounding them. Many claim that these models will revolutionize industries, create new opportunities, and solve complex problems. While it's true that they have the potential to do so, it's essential to separate the hype from the reality.</p>
<p>Generative AI models are not yet perfect. They can struggle with tasks like understanding context, nuance, and subtlety. They can also be biased, hallucinate, and produce misinformation. These limitations are crucial to acknowledge, as they can have significant consequences.</p>
<p><strong>The Science of Generative AI</strong></p>
<p>So, what's behind the science of generative AI models? In a word: data. Generative AI models are trained on vast amounts of data, which allows them to learn patterns and relationships. The quality and quantity of this data are critical, as they determine the model's ability to generalize and adapt.</p>
<p>Another crucial aspect is the architecture of the model. Generative AI models typically use neural networks, which are designed to mimic the human brain. These networks are composed of layers, each of which processes and transforms the input data.</p>
<p><strong>The Future of Generative AI</strong></p>
<p>As we look to the future, what can we expect from generative AI models? The possibilities are endless. We may see them used in applications like content creation, language translation, and even art and music composition.</p>
<p>However, it's essential to approach these models with caution. We need to ensure that they're developed and used responsibly, with a focus on ethics, transparency, and accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Generative AI models have come a long way since their inception. They've shown incredible potential, but it's crucial to separate the hype from the reality. As we move forward, it's essential to focus on the science, ethics, and responsible development of these models.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we've explored the journey of generative AI models, from their early beginnings to their current state-of-the-art applications. We've examined the challenges, limitations, and potential of these models, as well as the impact they may have on our daily lives.</p>
<p>As we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with generative AI models, let's remember to approach them with a critical eye and a focus on responsible development. The future is bright, but it's up to us to ensure that it's also bright for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>NDC 2024 London: Keynote Speech</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> "Building a Strong Foundation: A Journey Through REST, gRPC, and GraphQL"</p>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> [Name Not Provided]</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> [Date Not Provided]</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> London, UK</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> In this keynote speech, the speaker takes the audience on a journey through the world of REST, gRPC, and GraphQL, sharing their personal experiences and insights on building a strong foundation for modern web development.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Thank you everyone for joining me at NDC London today. I'm incredibly honored to be speaking here today. I have to say, someone told me I'd be speaking at NDC one day, and I thought they were kidding! But here I am, and I'm really pleased to be here.</p>
<p>Before I dive into my presentation, I just want to take a step back and talk about the importance of building a strong foundation in web development. As developers, we're constantly being asked to learn new technologies, new frameworks, and new languages. But how do we know which ones to choose? How do we build a strong foundation for our projects?</p>
<p>That's what I want to talk about today. I'll be sharing my personal experiences and insights on building a strong foundation using REST, gRPC, and GraphQL.</p>
<p><strong>REST: The Beauty of Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>Let's start with REST. REST is a fundamental concept in web development, and yet, it's often overlooked. I'd like to share a personal anecdote. When I first started learning about REST, I was reading Roy Thomas's PhD dissertation on the subject. It was a bit daunting, to be honest! But as I read through it, I realized that REST is actually quite simple. It's all about the six constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Client-Server Architecture</strong>: The client initiates the request, and the server responds.</li>
<li><strong>Stateless Interaction</strong>: Each request contains all the necessary information.</li>
<li><strong>Cacheable</strong>: Responses can be cached to improve performance.</li>
<li><strong>Uniform Interface</strong>: A uniform interface is used for all interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Layered System</strong>: The system is designed in a layered architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Code on the Client-side</strong>: The client-side code is responsible for processing the response.</li>
</ol>
<p>These constraints may seem simple, but they're the foundation of REST. And the beauty of REST is that it's easy to understand and implement. I've seen many developers struggle with REST, but once they understand these constraints, they're able to build robust and scalable systems.</p>
<p><strong>gRPC: The Power of Binary Data</strong></p>
<p>Now, let's talk about gRPC. gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework that allows you to build scalable and efficient systems. I'd like to share a personal experience with gRPC. I was working on a project that required real-time data updates. We were using REST, but it was taking a long time to update the data. We needed something faster, something that could handle the high volume of requests. That's when we discovered gRPC.</p>
<p>gRPC is built on top of HTTP/2, which allows for bidirectional streaming. This means that you can send and receive data simultaneously, without having to wait for a response. It's perfect for real-time applications.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of gRPC is its binary data format. Unlike REST, which uses JSON or XML, gRPC uses a binary format that's more efficient and faster to parse. This makes it ideal for systems that require high-performance.</p>
<p><strong>GraphQL: The Future of Data Querying</strong></p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows you to query data in a more efficient and flexible way. I'd like to share a personal experience with GraphQL. I was working on a project that required a lot of data querying. We were using REST, but it was becoming increasingly complex. We needed a way to query the data more efficiently. That's when we discovered GraphQL.</p>
<p>GraphQL is designed to be flexible and efficient. You can query data in a hierarchical manner, which makes it ideal for complex data structures. And the best part is that you can query only the data you need, which reduces the amount of data transmitted over the wire.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of GraphQL is its ability to handle complex queries. Unlike REST, which requires multiple requests to retrieve all the data, GraphQL allows you to retrieve all the data in a single request. This makes it ideal for systems that require complex data querying.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, building a strong foundation in web development is crucial for success. REST, gRPC, and GraphQL are all important technologies that can help you build robust and scalable systems. By understanding the constraints of REST, the power of binary data in gRPC, and the flexibility of GraphQL, you can build a strong foundation for your projects.</p>
<p>I hope you've enjoyed this journey through the world of REST, gRPC, and GraphQL. Remember, building a strong foundation is key to success in web development. Take the time to learn these technologies, and you'll be well on your way to building robust and scalable systems.</p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<p>Q: Can you tell us more about the importance of documentation in RESTful APIs?</p>
<p>A: Absolutely! Documentation is crucial in RESTful APIs. It's essential to provide clear and concise documentation that explains the API's behavior, including the request and response formats, error handling, and caching mechanisms.</p>
<p>Q: How do you handle caching in gRPC?</p>
<p>A: In gRPC, caching is handled through the use of caches and cache invalidation mechanisms. You can use caching libraries like Redis or Memcached to cache responses and reduce the number of requests to the server.</p>
<p>Q: Can you explain the difference between GraphQL and REST?</p>
<p>A: GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows you to query data in a more efficient and flexible way. REST is a fundamental concept in web development that provides a uniform interface for interacting with resources. While both technologies are used for API development, they serve different purposes and have different use cases.</p>
<p>Q: How do you handle errors in GraphQL?</p>
<p>A: In GraphQL, errors are handled through the use of error types and error messages. You can define custom error types and error messages to provide more detailed information about the error. Additionally, you can use error handling libraries like GraphQL Shield to handle errors more efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, building a strong foundation in web development is crucial for success. By understanding the constraints of REST, the power of binary data in gRPC, and the flexibility of GraphQL, you can build robust and scalable systems. Remember to always prioritize documentation, caching, and error handling to ensure that your systems are efficient and reliable. And always be open to learning new technologies and frameworks to stay ahead of the curve. Thank you for listening, and I hope you've enjoyed this journey through the world of REST, gRPC, and GraphQL.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 10: Legacy Code and Continuous Delivery - A Talk by Richard</strong></p>
<p>At the NDC 2024 London conference, Richard, a developer and occasional software archaeologist, took the stage to talk about legacy code and continuous delivery. With a hint of humor and a dash of self-deprecation, he shared his experiences and insights on how to deal with the challenges of working with legacy code.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem with Legacy Code</strong></p>
<p>Richard started by acknowledging that legacy code is a problem that many of us have encountered. He joked that it can mean one of two things: "a problem we want to laugh at, or a problem we want to cry about." He admitted that he's a developer, occasionally a software archaeologist, and a nice kind auditor who tries to help people audit their code.</p>
<p>He introduced his company, Myan Wolf, a German law company consultancy, and got started on the topic of continuous delivery. Richard's first question was: "What is legacy code?" He explained that it's code that's hard to maintain, and when you change one line of code, you're afraid of what might happen. He asked the audience if they've ever experienced this, and many nodded in agreement.</p>
<p><strong>A Story of Woe</strong></p>
<p>Richard shared a story about a piece of software called Apocalypto, which was a custom off-the-shelf software that his team was tasked with auditing. The code was a mess, with job queues running separately, and missing actions that couldn't be compiled. The team discovered that the code was using VBA code, Excel, and VB script, and that it was a nightmare to work with.</p>
<p>Richard joked that the team's first reaction was to want to refactor everything, but they realized that they couldn't do that without understanding the code. They spent weeks trying to figure out how it worked, and eventually, they found that the code was using a database that was missing completely. The team was faced with a 5 million-line codebase, and they realized that they had to approach it differently.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Version Control</strong></p>
<p>Richard emphasized the importance of version control, saying that it's a tool that's often underutilized. He explained that without version control, it's like trying to debug a black box, and that it's essential to have a system in place to track changes and collaborate with others.</p>
<p>He showed a slide that said, "Continuous Delivery: A Journey, Not a Destination," and explained that it's a mindset that involves delivering software in a sustainable way. He emphasized that it's not just about deploying code, but about making it releasable, and that it requires a culture of collaboration and communication.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Testing</strong></p>
<p>Richard talked about the importance of testing, saying that it's a crucial part of the development process. He explained that testing helps you understand the code, and that it's essential to have a good understanding of the code before you refactor it.</p>
<p>He showed a slide that said, "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is not just about writing tests, it's about writing tests that give you confidence," and explained that it's a technique that involves writing tests before you write the code. He emphasized that it's a mindset that involves thinking about the code before you write it, and that it's essential to have a good understanding of the requirements before you start coding.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits of Refactoring</strong></p>
<p>Richard talked about the benefits of refactoring, saying that it's a process that involves improving the design and structure of the code. He explained that it's essential to refactor code to make it more maintainable, and that it's a crucial part of the development process.</p>
<p>He showed a slide that said, "Refactoring is not just about rewriting code, it's about improving the design and structure of the code," and explained that it's a technique that involves breaking down complex code into smaller, more manageable pieces. He emphasized that it's essential to have a good understanding of the code before you refactor it, and that it's a process that requires patience and discipline.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Culture</strong></p>
<p>Richard talked about the importance of culture, saying that it's a crucial part of the development process. He explained that culture involves the values and norms that guide the way we work, and that it's essential to have a culture of collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>He showed a slide that said, "Culture is not just about what we do, it's about how we do it," and explained that it's a mindset that involves thinking about the way we work, and how we can improve it. He emphasized that it's essential to have a culture that values collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement, and that it's a culture that requires leadership and commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, Richard emphasized that legacy code is a problem that many of us have encountered, and that it requires a different approach. He emphasized that continuous delivery is a mindset that involves delivering software in a sustainable way, and that it requires a culture of collaboration and communication. He encouraged the audience to approach legacy code with a fresh set of eyes, and to use tools like version control and testing to make it more maintainable. He also emphasized the importance of refactoring, and the benefits it can bring to the codebase.</p>
<p>Overall, Richard's talk was a humorous and insightful look at the challenges of working with legacy code, and the importance of adopting a mindset of continuous delivery. He provided practical advice and strategies for dealing with legacy code, and emphasized the importance of culture and collaboration in the development process.</p>

<h1 id="ndc-2024-london-a-technical-deep-dive-into-norwegian-broadcasting-corporations-nrk-technology-stack">NDC 2024 London: A Technical Deep Dive into Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation's (NRK) Technology Stack</h1>
<p>At the 2024 NDC London conference, I had the opportunity to attend a fascinating talk by Gan and Yan, tech leads from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), about their technology stack and experiences with handling massive traffic spikes. In this chapter, I will summarize the key takeaways from their presentation.</p>
<h3 id="introduction_2">Introduction</h3>
<p>NRK is Norway's public service broadcaster, and as such, it has a commitment to providing high-quality public services to its users. With a significant portion of its users accessing its services online, NRK has had to develop a robust technology stack to handle the demands of its audience. In this talk, Gan and Yan delved into the technical details of NRK's technology stack, sharing their experiences with handling massive traffic spikes and the lessons they learned along the way.</p>
<h3 id="content-delivery-network-cdn-and-denial-of-service-dos-attacks">Content Delivery Network (CDN) and Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks</h3>
<p>Gan and Yan began by discussing NRK's use of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute its content and improve performance. They explained that NRK uses a CDN to cache its content, which helps to reduce the load on its servers and improve response times. However, this caching can also make it easier for attackers to launch Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which can overwhelm the CDN and bring down NRK's services.</p>
<p>To mitigate this risk, NRK uses a combination of techniques, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Akamai's CDN</strong>: NRK uses Akamai's CDN to distribute its content and protect against DoS attacks. Akamai's CDN is designed to handle massive traffic spikes and is able to detect and block suspicious traffic patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Web Application Firewall (WAF)</strong>: NRK uses a WAF to filter incoming traffic and block malicious requests. The WAF is configured to detect and block traffic patterns that are typical of DoS attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limiting</strong>: NRK implements rate limiting on its APIs to prevent excessive requests from overwhelming its servers. This helps to prevent DoS attacks and ensures that its services remain available to its users.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="load-testing-and-scalability">Load Testing and Scalability</h3>
<p>Gan and Yan also discussed NRK's approach to load testing and scalability. They explained that NRK uses a combination of load testing tools, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>k6</strong>: NRK uses k6, an open-source load testing tool, to simulate user traffic and test its services. k6 is designed to be highly scalable and can simulate thousands of users simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Gatling</strong>: NRK also uses Gatling, a commercial load testing tool, to test its services. Gatling is designed to be highly scalable and can simulate massive traffic spikes.</li>
</ul>
<p>NRK's approach to scalability is centered around the idea of "fail-fast" development. This means that NRK builds its services to fail quickly and safely, rather than trying to build a monolithic system that can handle all possible loads. This approach allows NRK to quickly identify and fix issues, rather than waiting for problems to arise.</p>
<h3 id="security-and-authentication">Security and Authentication</h3>
<p>Gan and Yan also discussed NRK's approach to security and authentication. They explained that NRK uses a combination of security measures, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OAuth 2.0</strong>: NRK uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users and provide secure access to its services. OAuth 2.0 is a widely-used authentication protocol that is designed to be highly secure.</li>
<li><strong>JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</strong>: NRK uses JWT to provide secure authentication and authorization for its services. JWT is a widely-used authentication protocol that is designed to be highly secure.</li>
<li><strong>HTTPS</strong>: NRK uses HTTPS to encrypt all communication between its users and its services. HTTPS is a widely-used encryption protocol that is designed to be highly secure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>Gan and Yan concluded their talk by sharing some of the lessons they had learned from their experiences with NRK's technology stack. They emphasized the importance of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing and load testing</strong>: NRK's approach to testing and load testing has been instrumental in identifying and fixing issues before they become critical.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: NRK's approach to scalability has allowed it to handle massive traffic spikes and ensure that its services remain available to its users.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: NRK's approach to security has helped to protect its users and its services from malicious attacks.</li>

<h1 id="ndc-2024-london-a-journey-through-devops-and-github">NDC 2024 London - A Journey Through DevOps and GitHub</h1>
<p>As I walked into the conference hall at NDC 2024 London, I was excited to learn about the latest trends and innovations in the world of software development. The first talk I attended was by April Edwards, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub, titled "A Journey Through DevOps and GitHub". April's talk was an engaging and informative exploration of the world of DevOps and GitHub, and I was thrilled to write it up as a chapter in this book.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of DevOps</strong></p>
<p>April started her talk by emphasizing the importance of DevOps in today's software development landscape. She pointed out that the traditional waterfall approach to software development, where developers build software and then hand it over to operations teams to deploy, is no longer sufficient. With the increasing complexity and speed of software development, DevOps has become a crucial aspect of the development process.</p>
<p>"DevOps is not just about tools, it's about culture, it's about people, and it's about process," April emphasized. "It's about bringing together development and operations teams to work together to deliver high-quality software quickly and reliably."</p>
<p><strong>The Role of GitHub in DevOps</strong></p>
<p>April then turned her attention to the role of GitHub in DevOps. She explained that GitHub is not just a version control system, but a platform that enables collaboration, automation, and continuous integration and delivery.</p>
<p>"GitHub is not just a place to store your code," April said. "It's a place to collaborate with your team, to automate your processes, and to deliver your software to your users quickly and reliably."</p>
<p><strong>The GitHub Platform</strong></p>
<p>April gave a tour of the GitHub platform, highlighting its features and capabilities. She showed how GitHub's code review and pull request system enables developers to collaborate on code, and how its issue tracking system enables teams to track and prioritize issues.</p>
<p>She also demonstrated GitHub's automation capabilities, such as GitHub Actions, which enables developers to automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying their code.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Automation</strong></p>
<p>April emphasized the importance of automation in DevOps, citing a study that showed that automated testing and deployment can reduce deployment time by up to 90%.</p>
<p>"Automation is not just about saving time, it's about reducing errors and improving quality," April said. "It's about enabling your teams to focus on what they do best, rather than getting bogged down in manual tasks."</p>
<p><strong>The Future of DevOps and GitHub</strong></p>
<p>Finally, April looked to the future of DevOps and GitHub, highlighting some of the exciting new features and capabilities that are coming down the pipeline.</p>
<p>"We're always looking for ways to make GitHub better and more powerful," April said. "We're working on new features such as GitHub Copilot, which will enable developers to write code faster and more accurately. We're also working on improving our automation capabilities, and on making it easier for teams to collaborate and work together."</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As April wrapped up her talk, I was left with a sense of excitement and optimism about the future of DevOps and GitHub. It's clear that GitHub is committed to enabling developers to build high-quality software quickly and reliably, and that the company is constantly innovating and improving its platform to meet the needs of its users.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 5: "Security in the Modern Era: Lessons from NDC 2024 London"</strong></p>
<p>As I walked into the auditorium at NDC 2024 London, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. The conference was packed with some of the most brilliant minds in the industry, all gathered to share their knowledge and insights on the latest trends and best practices in software development. I was particularly looking forward to the talk on security, given the increasing importance of this topic in today's digital landscape.</p>
<p>The presenter, Glenn, a consultant from a small law-tech startup in Norway, took the stage with a calm confidence. He began by sharing a personal anecdote about his own experience with security breaches, which set the tone for the rest of the talk.</p>
<p>"I once worked with a bank employee who was selling customer information to gossip magazines. Can you believe it? The employee had access to the bank's database and was using it to make a quick buck. It was a wake-up call for me, and it made me realize just how important it is to have robust security measures in place."</p>
<p>Glenn went on to discuss the concept of "zero trust," a security model that assumes all users and devices are potential threats. "In a zero-trust environment, every access request is verified and authenticated, and every transaction is monitored and audited. It's a much more proactive approach to security, rather than simply reacting to incidents after they've occurred."</p>
<p>He also touched on the importance of least privilege access, where users are only granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. "This is a huge improvement over the old model of giving everyone the same level of access and hoping for the best. With least privilege, you're significantly reducing the attack surface and making it much harder for malicious actors to get their hands on sensitive data."</p>
<p>Another key theme Glenn emphasized was the need for explicit auditable access. "In today's world, it's not enough to simply grant access and hope that everything will be okay. You need to be able to track every access request, every login, and every transaction. This is where auditing comes in – it's the ability to track and review every action taken on your system, so you can identify and respond to incidents quickly and effectively."</p>
<p>Glenn also discussed the importance of using secure protocols for data transmission and storage. "When it comes to data, you need to assume that it's going to be compromised at some point. That's why it's so important to use secure protocols like HTTPS and encryption. These protocols make it much harder for malicious actors to intercept and steal sensitive data."</p>
<p>As the talk drew to a close, Glenn emphasized the importance of continuous learning and improvement. "Security is a never-ending battle, and you need to stay one step ahead of the bad guys at all times. That means staying up-to-date with the latest threats and vulnerabilities, and continuously testing and refining your security measures."</p>
<p>The audience was left with a lot to think about, and I was grateful for the opportunity to learn from Glenn's expertise. As I left the auditorium, I couldn't help but feel a sense of renewed commitment to prioritizing security in my own work.</p>

<p><strong>Neural Style Transfer: The Art of Generative AI</strong></p>
<p><strong>NDC 2024 London</strong></p>
<p><strong>Session: Wednesday Morning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speaker: [Name]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Good morning, everyone! Welcome to our session on Neural Style Transfer: The Art of Generative AI. I'm excited to share with you my thoughts on this fascinating topic. As someone who works in the Bay Area, I often find myself in conversations about generative AI, and I want to ask, have you ever felt like you're stuck in a bubble? A bubble where everyone is talking about the same thing, like crypto, NFTs, or generative AI? I think we're all aware of the buzz surrounding generative AI, but is it really going to revolutionize our daily lives? Or is it just another fleeting trend?</p>
<p><strong>Neural Style Transfer: What is it?</strong></p>
<p>Before we dive into the art of generative AI, let's talk about neural style transfer. In simple terms, neural style transfer is a concept that takes content from one image and applies a different style to create a new image. Think of it like taking a photo of a cat and applying the brushstrokes of Van Gogh to create a unique piece of art.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>
<p>Neural style transfer uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve this magic. A CNN is a deep learning model that is primarily used in the field of image analysis. It's like a detective that looks at an image and identifies objects, patterns, and shapes. The CNN is trained on a large dataset of images, and its job is to detect and recognize various features, such as edges, lines, and shapes.</p>
<p><strong>The Loss Function</strong></p>
<p>The neural style transfer algorithm adds a loss function to the CNN to achieve the desired style transformation. The loss function is what tells the algorithm how to modify the image to achieve the desired style. The algorithm iteratively applies the loss function to the image until it reaches the desired output.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network</strong></p>
<p>The pre-trained CNN is the backbone of the neural style transfer algorithm. It's trained on a large dataset of images, which allows it to learn the features and patterns of the images. The CNN is then fine-tuned to achieve the desired style transformation.</p>
<p><strong>The Art of Generative AI</strong></p>
<p>The art of generative AI is not just about creating new images, but also about understanding the underlying principles of art and creativity. Generative AI is like a painter that uses algorithms to create art. The painter is guided by the loss function, which tells it how to modify the brushstrokes and colors to achieve the desired style.</p>
<p><strong>Applications</strong></p>
<p>Neural style transfer has many practical applications in various fields, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Art</strong>: Prisma, a popular app, uses neural style transfer to transform photos into works of art. You can imagine applying the style of famous artists like Van Gogh or Picasso to your own photos.</li>
<li><strong>Film Production</strong>: Neural style transfer can be used to create special effects in movies and TV shows. For example, a low-budget movie production team can use neural style transfer to create a high-end look without breaking the bank.</li>
<li><strong>Photography</strong>: Neural style transfer can be used to enhance and transform photos. For example, a photographer can use it to create a unique style for their portfolio or to enhance the aesthetic of a particular photo.</li>
<li><strong>Branding and Design</strong>: Neural style transfer can be used to create unique designs and branding materials. For example, a company can use it to create a distinctive visual identity for their brand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medical Imaging</strong></p>
<p>Neural style transfer has also been applied to medical imaging, where it can be used to enhance images and highlight specific features. For example, in X-ray imaging, neural style transfer can be used to enhance the visibility of specific features or to highlight certain areas of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, neural style transfer is a powerful tool that has many practical applications in various fields. It's not just about creating new images, but also about understanding the underlying principles of art and creativity. As we continue to develop this technology, we can expect to see more innovative applications and uses. Thank you for joining me on this journey into the world of neural style transfer.</p>

<li><strong>Automated testing</strong>: Use automated testing to reduce the amount of manual testing, freeing up time for more important tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-ugly-truth-continues"><strong>The Ugly Truth Continues</strong></h2>
<p>Tess then delved deeper into the darker side of code review:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gatekeeping</strong>: Some reviewers act as gatekeepers, holding up the review process with unnecessary comments or requests.</li>
<li><strong>Assuming expertise</strong>: Reviewers assume they know more than they do, leading to incorrect assumptions and mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Fear of conflict</strong>: Reviewers are afraid to speak up, fearing conflict or retribution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-power-of-feedback"><strong>The Power of Feedback</strong></h2>
<p>Tess emphasized the importance of feedback in the code review process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specific feedback</strong>: Provide specific feedback, rather than general comments or criticisms.</li>
<li><strong>Actionable feedback</strong>: Make feedback actionable, by suggesting concrete changes or improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback as a gift</strong>: View feedback as a gift, an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than a criticism.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-way-forward"><strong>The Way Forward</strong></h2>
<p>Tess concluded by sharing her own approach to code review:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Respectful feedback</strong>: Provide feedback in a respectful and constructive manner.</li>

<h1 id="chapter-7-the-whimsy-of-data-storage"><strong>Chapter 7: "The Whimsy of Data Storage"</strong></h1>
<p>The NDC 2024 London conference was a treasure trove of fascinating discussions and insights into the world of technology. One talk that particularly caught my attention was the whimsical journey through the history of data storage, led by an enthusiastic speaker who regaled the audience with tales of ancient civilizations, magnetic tapes, and even DNA encoding. In this chapter, I'll attempt to recreate the essence of that talk, using the transcript provided.</p>
<h2 id="the-ancient-roots-of-data-storage"><strong>The Ancient Roots of Data Storage</strong></h2>
<p>The speaker began by delving into the earliest forms of data storage, tracing the thread of innovation from ancient civilizations to modern times. "We've been storing data for thousands of years," they exclaimed, "from clay tablets to floppy discs, each era bringing its own unique solution to the problem of preserving information."</p>
<p>The audience was taken on a whirlwind tour of the Bronze Age, where we learned about the ingenious use of clay tablets to record important messages and transactions. "The Sumerians developed a system of writing called cuneiform," the speaker explained, "where they would inscribe symbols on clay tablets using a reed stylus. This technology allowed them to record laws, business transactions, and even literature."</p>
<p>As the years went by, new materials and techniques emerged, such as the use of papyrus and parchment in ancient Egypt and Greece. "The Egyptians developed a sophisticated system of hieroglyphics," the speaker noted, "while the Greeks used papyrus to record their literary works and philosophical ideas."</p>
<h2 id="the-advent-of-magnetic-tapes"><strong>The Advent of Magnetic Tapes</strong></h2>
<p>The next stop on our journey was the Industrial Revolution, where magnetic tapes became the go-to medium for data storage. "In the 1950s, magnetic tapes were invented," the speaker explained, "revolutionizing the way we store and retrieve data. These tapes could record hours of audio and video, and even store large amounts of digital data."</p>
<p>The audience was treated to a fascinating anecdote about the first magnetic tapes, which were used to store the first computer programs. "The first computer program was written in 1947," the speaker said, "and it was stored on a magnetic tape. Can you imagine the excitement of those pioneers, watching their code come to life on a computer screen?"</p>
<h2 id="the-rise-of-hard-drives-and-flash-memory"><strong>The Rise of Hard Drives and Flash Memory</strong></h2>
<p>As the years went by, hard drives and flash memory emerged as dominant players in the data storage landscape. "The first hard drive was invented in the 1950s," the speaker noted, "and it was the size of a small car. Today, we have hard drives that can store hundreds of gigabytes of data."</p>
<p>The audience was also introduced to the concept of flash memory, which has become ubiquitous in modern devices. "Flash memory is a type of non-volatile memory," the speaker explained, "that can store data even when power is turned off. This has revolutionized the way we store and retrieve data on our smartphones, tablets, and laptops."</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-data-storage-dna-encoding"><strong>The Future of Data Storage: DNA Encoding</strong></h2>
<p>The speaker then took us on a fascinating detour into the world of DNA encoding, where the audience learned about the potential of using DNA to store vast amounts of data. "DNA is incredibly compact," the speaker said, "and it can store enormous amounts of data in a tiny package. Imagine storing a movie library on a single strand of DNA!"</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 10: "OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect: A Journey Through the World of Authentication"</strong></p>
<p>The NDC 2024 London conference was a thrilling event, with speakers from all over the world sharing their expertise and insights on various topics in the tech industry. One of the most exciting talks was given by a seasoned expert in the field of authentication, who took the audience on a journey through the world of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.</p>
<p><strong>The Early Days of Authentication</strong></p>
<p>The speaker began by talking about the early days of authentication, when the concept of security was still in its infancy. He mentioned how the first web-based protocols, such as NTLM and Kerberos, were developed to provide secure authentication for users. However, these protocols were limited in their scope and were not designed to handle the complexity of modern web applications.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of OAuth 2.0</strong></p>
<p>The speaker then moved on to talk about the rise of OAuth 2.0, which was introduced in 2010 as a simpler and more flexible alternative to traditional authentication protocols. OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows clients to access resources on behalf of the resource owner, without sharing their credentials. The speaker explained how OAuth 2.0 uses a client-server architecture, with the client requesting an access token from the authorization server, which is then used to access the protected resources.</p>
<p><strong>OpenID Connect</strong></p>
<p>The speaker then delved into the world of OpenID Connect, which is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that adds a layer of authentication on top of the authorization framework. OpenID Connect allows users to authenticate with a provider and receive an ID token, which can be used to authenticate with other services. The speaker explained how OpenID Connect uses a JSON Web Token (JWT) to represent the user's identity, and how the token is signed with a private key to ensure its authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>Token Types</strong></p>
<p>The speaker then discussed the different types of tokens used in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, including access tokens, ID tokens, and refresh tokens. He explained how access tokens are used to access protected resources, while ID tokens are used to authenticate the user's identity. Refresh tokens, on the other hand, are used to obtain new access tokens when the existing one expires.</p>
<p><strong>Client-Server Architecture</strong></p>
<p>The speaker then walked the audience through the client-server architecture of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, explaining how the client requests an access token from the authorization server, and how the server responds with an access token and a JSON Web Token (JWT). He also explained how the client can use the access token to access the protected resources, and how the server can use the JWT to verify the user's identity.</p>
<p><strong>Case Study: Calendar Widget</strong></p>
<p>To illustrate the concepts, the speaker used a case study of a calendar widget that needs to access the user's Google calendar. He explained how the calendar widget would request an access token from the authorization server, and how the server would respond with an access token and a JWT. He also explained how the calendar widget would use the access token to access the user's calendar, and how the server would use the JWT to verify the user's identity.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices</strong></p>
<p>The speaker then shared some best practices for implementing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, including the importance of using secure protocols, validating tokens, and handling errors. He also emphasized the importance of testing and debugging, and provided some tips for troubleshooting common issues.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, the speaker wrapped up the talk by summarizing the key concepts of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, and emphasizing the importance of understanding the intricacies of these protocols in order to build secure and scalable web applications. He encouraged the audience to continue learning and exploring the world of authentication, and to share their own experiences and insights with the community.</p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A Session</strong></p>
<p>The talk concluded with a Q&amp;A session, where the speaker answered questions from the audience and provided more insights and examples. The audience was engaged and enthusiastic, and the speaker's enthusiasm was infectious. The talk was a great success, and the audience left with a better understanding of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, and a newfound appreciation for the importance of authentication in the world of web development.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 10: Incremental Migration of ASP.NET MVC 5 to ASP.NET Core</strong></p>
<p>At the NDC 2024 London conference, Jimmy Bogard delivered a presentation on the incremental migration of ASP.NET MVC 5 to ASP.NET Core. The presentation covered the challenges and best practices involved in this process. In this chapter, we will summarize the key takeaways from the presentation.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenges of Migration</strong></p>
<p>Migrating from ASP.NET MVC 5 to ASP.NET Core can be a daunting task. The biggest challenge is the difference in architecture between the two frameworks. ASP.NET MVC 5 is based on the traditional ASP.NET pipeline, while ASP.NET Core is based on a new pipeline that is designed to be more modular and extensible.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the differences in the way that ASP.NET Core handles dependency injection, middleware, and routing. ASP.NET Core uses a more modular approach, which can make it more difficult to integrate with third-party libraries and frameworks that are designed for ASP.NET MVC 5.</p>
<p><strong>The Incremental Migration Process</strong></p>
<p>The key to a successful migration is to approach it incrementally. This means breaking down the migration into smaller, manageable chunks, and tackling each chunk one at a time.</p>
<p>The first step is to identify the parts of the application that need to be migrated. This may involve creating a list of the features and components that need to be updated, and prioritizing them based on their importance and complexity.</p>
<p>Once the components have been identified, the next step is to create a plan for migrating each component. This may involve creating a new ASP.NET Core project, and then gradually migrating the code from the ASP.NET MVC 5 project to the new project.</p>
<p><strong>Migrating Controllers and Actions</strong></p>
<p>One of the most challenging parts of the migration process is migrating controllers and actions. ASP.NET MVC 5 uses a different approach to routing than ASP.NET Core, which can make it difficult to map the old routes to the new routes.</p>
<p>To overcome this challenge, Jimmy suggested using the <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Routing</code> package to create a mapping between the old routes and the new routes. This package provides a set of extension methods that can be used to map the old routes to the new routes.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the differences in the way that ASP.NET Core handles dependency injection and middleware. ASP.NET Core uses a more modular approach, which can make it more difficult to integrate with third-party libraries and frameworks that are designed for ASP.NET MVC 5.</p>
<p><strong>Migrating Views and Templates</strong></p>
<p>Migrating views and templates is another challenging part of the migration process. ASP.NET MVC 5 uses a different approach to templating than ASP.NET Core, which can make it difficult to convert the old views to the new views.</p>
<p>To overcome this challenge, Jimmy suggested using the <code>RazorEngine</code> package to convert the old views to the new views. This package provides a set of tools that can be used to convert the old views to the new views, including a converter that can convert the old Razor syntax to the new Razor syntax.</p>
<p><strong>Migrating Session and Authentication</strong></p>
<p>Migrating session and authentication is another challenging part of the migration process. ASP.NET MVC 5 uses a different approach to session management and authentication than ASP.NET Core, which can make it difficult to convert the old session and authentication mechanisms to the new mechanisms.</p>
<p>To overcome this challenge, Jimmy suggested using the <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Session</code> package to convert the old session mechanisms to the new mechanisms. This package provides a set of tools that can be used to convert the old session mechanisms to the new mechanisms, including a converter that can convert the old session state to the new session state.</p>
<p><strong>Migrating Hangfire</strong></p>
<p>Migrating Hangfire is another challenging part of the migration process. Hangfire is a package that provides a set of tools for scheduling and running background jobs in ASP.NET applications. ASP.NET MVC 5 uses a different approach to Hangfire than ASP.NET Core, which can make it difficult to convert the old Hangfire mechanisms to the new mechanisms.</p>
<p>To overcome this challenge, Jimmy suggested using the <code>Hangfire.AspNetCore</code> package to convert the old Hangfire mechanisms to the new mechanisms. This package provides a set of tools that can be used to convert the old Hangfire mechanisms to the new mechanisms, including a converter that can convert the old Hangfire jobs to the new Hangfire jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, the incremental migration of ASP.NET MVC 5 to ASP.NET Core is a challenging process that requires careful planning and execution. The key to a successful migration is to approach it incrementally, and to use the right tools and techniques to overcome the challenges that are involved.</p>
<p>By following the best practices and strategies outlined in this chapter, developers can successfully migrate their ASP.NET MVC 5 applications to ASP.NET Core, and take advantage of the new features and improvements that ASP.NET Core provides.</p>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM3Lkp0d4hw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM3Lkp0d4hw</a></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 7: The Pickle Story - A Lesson in Interface Design</strong></p>
<p>At the 2024 NDC London conference, Dean presented a fascinating talk on the importance of interface design and how it can lead to catastrophic consequences. His story, which he referred to as the "Pickle Story," was a real-life example of how a seemingly small design flaw can have far-reaching and devastating effects.</p>
<p><strong>The Pickle Story</strong></p>
<p>Dean began his talk by introducing himself as a "UX guy" and sharing his personal experience with a company called Jason's Deli, a popular sandwich shop with locations across the United States. Dean explained that he doesn't like pickles, but his company makes them a default topping on their sandwiches.</p>
<p>The first time Dean visited Jason's Deli, he asked for a turkey sandwich without pickles. However, when he received his sandwich, it still had pickles on it. Dean was frustrated and asked the attendant, Frank, to remove the pickles. Frank, however, simply said "okay" and gave Dean his sandwich with the pickles still on it.</p>
<p>Dean was confused and thought that Frank didn't understand his request. He decided to try a different approach and asked Frank to customize his sandwich with no pickles. Frank again said "okay" and gave Dean his sandwich with... pickles. Dean was starting to get frustrated and asked Frank to explain why he was still getting pickles. Frank simply shrugged and said "I guess you want pickles?"</p>
<p>At this point, Dean was fed up and decided to investigate the issue further. He discovered that the problem wasn't with Frank, but with the interface design of the cash register system. The system was designed with a single button for "crisp pickles" and another button for "regular pickles." However, the buttons were not labeled clearly, and the system didn't provide any feedback to the user when they selected a option.</p>
<p>Dean explained that this design flaw led to a 78-79% failure rate when customers asked for a sandwich without pickles. He also discovered that the system was not designed to handle errors and would simply continue to default to the pickles option.</p>
<p><strong>The Butterfly Effect</strong></p>
<p>Dean used the Pickle Story to illustrate the concept of the butterfly effect, which states that small, seemingly insignificant changes can have significant and far-reaching consequences. He explained that the design flaw in the cash register system was a small issue, but it had a significant impact on the customer experience.</p>
<p>Dean also drew parallels between the Pickle Story and other real-life examples of interface design gone wrong. He mentioned the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident, which was caused by a combination of human error and design flaws in the control room interface. He also referenced the 2000 US presidential election, which was marred by irregularities in the voting system, including the infamous "butterfly ballot."</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of User Testing</strong></p>
<p>Dean emphasized the importance of user testing and usability in software design. He explained that the Pickle Story was a result of a lack of user testing and a failure to consider the needs of the user. He encouraged developers to prioritize user testing and to test their software with real users to identify potential issues.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Storytelling</strong></p>
<p>Dean's talk was a powerful example of the importance of storytelling in software development. He used a personal anecdote to illustrate a complex technical concept and to make it more relatable to his audience. His story was engaging and entertaining, and it helped to drive home the importance of interface design and user testing.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, Dean's Pickle Story was a thought-provoking talk that highlighted the importance of interface design and user testing in software development. His personal experience with Jason's Deli was a powerful example of how a small design flaw can have significant consequences, and his story was a reminder of the importance of prioritizing user needs and testing our software with real users.</p>

<h1 id="ndc-2024-london-seven-deadly-sins-of-ef-core-by-jk">NDC 2024 London: "Seven Deadly Sins of EF Core" by JK</h1>
<p>At the NDC 2024 London conference, JK, a seasoned developer and Microsoft AI MVP, took the stage to deliver a thought-provoking talk on the "Seven Deadly Sins of EF Core". In this chapter, we'll explore the transcript of the talk, highlighting JK's insights and experiences on the common pitfalls and best practices of using Entity Framework Core (EF Core) in .NET development.</p>
<h3 id="introduction_4">Introduction</h3>
<p>JK started the talk by introducing himself and sharing his excitement about being at NDC 2024 London. He mentioned that he'd be talking about the "Seven Deadly Sins of EF Core" and encouraged the audience to take note of the common mistakes they might be making when using EF Core.</p>
<h3 id="sin-1-asynchronous-tracking">Sin #1: Asynchronous Tracking</h3>
<p>JK began by discussing the first sin: Asynchronous Tracking. He explained that many developers make the mistake of using <code>IQueryable</code> instead of <code>IEnumerable</code> when dealing with EF Core. This can lead to unexpected performance issues, as the query is executed on the server-side instead of being executed locally.</p>
<p>JK shared an example of a common mistake: using <code>IQueryable</code> to retrieve a list of sales records, which then gets executed on the server-side. This can cause performance issues, especially when dealing with large datasets.</p>
<p>To avoid this sin, JK recommended using <code>IEnumerable</code> instead, which executes the query locally and returns the results as a collection.</p>
<h3 id="sin-2-incorrect-use-of-include">Sin #2: Incorrect Use of Include</h3>
<p>JK moved on to the second sin: Incorrect Use of Include. He explained that many developers mistakenly use <code>Include</code> to eagerly load related data, which can lead to performance issues and increased memory usage.</p>
<p>JK shared an example of a common mistake: using <code>Include</code> to load a list of customers with their orders, which can result in a large amount of data being loaded into memory.</p>
<p>To avoid this sin, JK recommended using lazy loading instead, which loads related data on demand and reduces memory usage.</p>
<h3 id="sin-3-using-asynchronous-queries">Sin #3: Using Asynchronous Queries</h3>
<p>JK discussed the third sin: Using Asynchronous Queries. He explained that many developers make the mistake of using <code>Task.Run</code> to execute queries asynchronously, which can lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues.</p>
<p>JK shared an example of a common mistake: using <code>Task.Run</code> to execute a query asynchronously, which can cause the query to be executed multiple times and return incorrect results.</p>
<p>To avoid this sin, JK recommended using <code>IQueryable</code> instead, which allows for asynchronous execution of queries without the need for <code>Task.Run</code>.</p>
<h3 id="sin-4-incorrect-use-of-pagination">Sin #4: Incorrect Use of Pagination</h3>
<p>JK moved on to the fourth sin: Incorrect Use of Pagination. He explained that many developers make the mistake of using <code>Skip</code> and <code>Take</code> methods to implement pagination, which can lead to performance issues and incorrect results.</p>
<p>JK shared an example of a common mistake: using <code>Skip</code> and <code>Take</code> methods to retrieve a list of sales records, which can cause the query to be executed multiple times and return incorrect results.</p>
<p>To avoid this sin, JK recommended using <code>Range</code> method instead, which allows for efficient pagination and reduces the number of database queries.</p>
<h3 id="sin-5-not-using-cancelable-queries">Sin #5: Not Using Cancelable Queries</h3>
<p>JK discussed the fifth sin: Not Using Cancelable Queries. He explained that many developers make the mistake of not using cancelable queries, which can lead to performance issues and increased memory usage.</p>
<p>JK shared an example of a common mistake: not using cancelable queries to retrieve a large dataset, which can cause the query to be executed multiple times and consume excessive resources.</p>
<p>To avoid this sin, JK recommended using <code>IQueryable</code> and <code>IAsyncEnumerable</code> interfaces, which provide support for cancelable queries and efficient data retrieval.</p>
<h3 id="sin-6-incorrect-use-of-select">Sin #6: Incorrect Use of Select</h3>
<p>JK moved on to the sixth sin: Incorrect Use of Select. He explained that many developers make the mistake of using <code>Select</code> method to retrieve a list of objects, which can lead to performance issues and incorrect results.</p>
<p>JK shared an example of a common mistake: using <code>Select</code> method to retrieve a list of sales records, which can cause the query to be executed multiple times and return incorrect results.</p>
<p>To avoid this sin, JK recommended using <code>Select</code> method with <code>AsNoTracking</code> option, which allows for efficient retrieval of data and reduces the number of database queries.</p>
<h3 id="sin-7-not-using-sql-server-provider">Sin #7: Not Using SQL Server Provider</h3>
<p>JK concluded the talk by discussing the seventh and final sin: Not Using SQL Server Provider. He explained that many developers make the mistake of not using SQL Server provider, which can lead to performance issues and reduced functionality.</p>
<p>JK shared an example of a common mistake: not using SQL Server provider to execute a query, which can cause the query to be executed multiple times and return incorrect results.</p>
<p>To avoid this sin, JK recommended using SQL Server provider, which provides efficient query execution and reduced memory usage.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion_14">Conclusion</h3>
<p>JK concluded the talk by summarizing the seven deadly sins of EF Core and emphasizing the importance of following best practices to avoid common pitfalls. He encouraged the audience to take note of the mistakes and apply the lessons learned to their own projects.</p>

<li>Ivan Font is a Red Hat employee who has been working on web assembly for several years. He started from an embedded Linux background and switched to cloud software.</li>
<li>Web assembly (Wasum) is a technology used to run code in the browser or server. It's like a virtual machine that can execute code in user space, either Standalone or embedded as a module.</li>
<li>Wasum is not a replacement for containers. They serve different purposes: containers provide an operating system and process isolation while Wasum provides low-level hardware operation instructions and runs as a single threaded stack based VM.</li>
<li>Web assembly is lightweight and fast because it's compiled ahead of time, which also makes it portable across different architectures and platforms. It doesn't have memory management or garbage collection, so developers need to manage those manually.</li>
<li>Web assembly has been used for various purposes such as cloud middleware, event-driven microservices, edge computing, and even in web browsers as an alternative to plugins.</li>
<li>Wasum can be used with different languages like Rust, C, Go, and JavaScript. It's also compatible with web standards like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a versatile tool for building applications.</li>
<li>The speaker mentioned some tools and technologies related to Wasum such as Podman, WASI (Web Assembly System Interface), OCI image format, and various container runtimes.</li>
<li>There were questions from the audience about multithreading, security, performance, and portability of Wasum compared to containers. The speaker provided some insights on those topics but encouraged further discussion.</li>
<li>Web assembly has been evolving rapidly since its introduction in 2015 and is becoming increasingly popular for building cloud software due to its lightweight, fast, and portable nature. It's also being used more in edge computing and event-driven microservices.</li>
<li>Wasum allows developers to run untrusted code safely in a sandboxed environment using the WASI system call layer and capability-based security model.</li>
<li>The speaker demonstrated how to build and deploy a simple Rust application as a Wasum module using Podman, which showed its small size and fast execution.</li>
<li>Web assembly is being adopted by various companies for their production workloads due to its performance benefits and ability to run on different architectures with minimal changes. It's also being used in edge computing and event-driven microservices.</li>
<li>The speaker encouraged the audience to experiment with web assembly, especially in the context of edge computing, as it provides a small resource footprint and is well-suited for that use case. He also mentioned some ongoing developments such as support for interpreting JIT (just-in-time) compilation mode and integration with various frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenVino, and Onyx.</li>

<li>Solution: externalize large binary data to a separate storage system and reference it with an identifier</li>
<li>Demo: producer sends image data to MinIO object storage, consumer retrieves claim check (identifier) from Kafka topic and loads the actual data from MinIO</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="content-richer-pattern">Content Richer Pattern</h2>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: sparse failure payloads contain little information</li>
<li>Solution: enrich events at the source with additional data and send it along to consumers</li>
<li>Demo: IoT sensor data processing, enriched event contains raw sensor data and metadata</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="message-translator-pattern">Message Translator Pattern</h2>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: incompatible or inconvenient payload formats</li>
<li>Solution: translate payloads into a format that is consumable by the target system</li>
<li>Demo: Point of Sale data processing, Kafka connect transforms CSV to JSON and sends it to the target web API without additional coding</li>

<li>Benedict Pavel is a principal software engineer and active contributor to the Open Telemetry project, focusing on distributed tracing.</li>
<li>History of observability:</li>
<li>xtrace (2007): Platform for storing, visualizing Telemetry data.</li>
<li>Apache Skywalking/Hypertrace/Signal (2014): End-to-end observability platform using a proprietary data model.</li>
<li>OpenTracing (2016): Open source project providing a standardized approach to distributed tracing by defining a specification document.</li>
<li>Jaeger and Zipkin (2018): Competing projects merged in 2019 to form the OpenTelemetry Project.</li>
<li>Auto-instrumentation and auto-collection (2019 onward): The next big innovation in observability, with open source high-quality agents and auto instrumentation.</li>
<li>Introducing Open Telemetry:</li>
<li>A vendor-neutral, open source data collection platform for monitoring modern applications.</li>
<li>Components: API, SDK, standardized data model (OpenTelemetry Protocol), collector, and auto-instrumentation agent.</li>
<li>Instrumenting an application with Open Telemetry:</li>
<li>Three approaches: Manual explicit approach (using APIs), direct integration into runtimes, and auto instrumentation using an agent.<ul>
<li>Manual explicit approach: Requires developer effort but offers more control and flexibility.</li>
<li>Direct integration into runtimes: Easiest to get started but limited to supported frameworks and runtimes.</li>
<li>Auto-instrumentation using an agent: Requires minimal effort, can support a wide range of frameworks, but consumes resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OpenTelemetry Collector: A data pipeline component that receives and processes Telemetry data. It consists of three steps: receiver, processor, and exporter.<ul>
<li>Receiver: Reads data from various sources, such as logs or metrics.</li>
<li>Processor: Parses and normalizes the received data, applying filters, relabeling, and deduplication.</li>
<li>Exporter: Sends the processed data to different destinations for storage or analysis, such as Prometheus, Jaeger, or Splunk.</li>

<li>Host Natalie Vint introduces Clement Hartur and Julia Caucus, who will talk about integrating Loom Quarkus.</li>
<li>Loom is a threading model that allows efficient execution of concurrent tasks.</li>
<li>Java has an imperative execution model which can be simple but expensive in terms of memory and thread usage for concurrent applications.</li>
<li>Reactive programming models like Loom can improve resource efficiency and concurrency by using event loops and virtual threads.</li>
<li>Virtual threads are lightweight and can be created quickly, reducing the need for thread pools and isolation processing requests one at a time.</li>
<li>Loom has a carrier thread model which manages event loops and handles IO tasks while virtual threads process application logic.</li>
<li>Clement explains that parking of carrier threads can lead to blocking and performance issues, but Loom team is addressing this with improvements in future releases.</li>
<li>Quarkus is a Java framework that supports both imperative and reactive programming models, and can integrate with Loom for improved concurrency and efficiency.</li>
<li>Loom provides a way to block without making the carrying thread wait, using asynchronous constructs like Mutiny.</li>
<li>Julia discusses some performance benchmarks showing improvements in throughput and latency with Loom compared to traditional blocking models.</li>
<li>Clement also mentions that Loom can reduce pinning phenomenon by allowing virtual threads to be released immediately when a result is available, instead of waiting for the carry thread to become available again.</li>
<li>The team is honest about the challenges and limitations of Loom, such as occasional parking of carrier threads and the need for customization in some cases.</li>
<li>Julia suggests that Loom can improve resource efficiency by reducing the number of pinning events and improving environment deployment capacity.</li>
<li>Clement also mentions that Loom can improve high-level concurrency by handling server requests more efficiently, and that it can be used with various databases and APIs.</li>
<li>They invite questions from the audience and discuss various use cases and implementation details.</li>

<li>Welcome to DevNation Live tech talk about Quarkus and Cassandra microservices.</li>
<li>Speaker is Raghavan Srinivas, mechanical engineer and distributed systems enthusiast.</li>
<li>Agenda: Intro to nosql databases (Cassandra), ACID vs CAP theorem, and Quarkus integration with Cassandra.</li>
<li>Nosql stands for "not only SQL". It's a commodity hardware that can scale horizontally and is suitable for modern distributed systems like Kubernetes.</li>
<li>Cassandra is a popular nosql database known for its horizontal scaling capabilities and ease of multicluster, multiregion deployment.</li>
<li>ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions are guaranteed in traditional relational databases but not in nosql like Cassandra. Instead, it follows the CAP theorem which states that a distributed system can only guarantee two of three: consistency, availability, partition tolerance.</li>
<li>Quarkus is a framework for Java and Java EE developers to create microservices and reduce boot time with a native image feature.</li>
<li>Quarkus has native support for Cassandra databases through its extension which provides session handling and object mapping capabilities.</li>
<li>Microservices are independent components that can be deployed, scaled, and developed differently. They follow the REST architectural style and have a loosely coupled architecture.</li>
<li>The advantages of using microservices include reduced cost, reduced risk, increased complexity, and cultural change.</li>
<li>Quarkus allows us to write clean, concise code with a simple setup and fast development process.</li>
<li>We'll see a live coding demo of building a simple todo application using Cassandra as the database and Quarkus for microservices development.</li>
<li>Speaker encourages attendees to try the Quarkus workshop for free and earn badges by completing tasks.</li>

<ul>
<li>Bernard, Technical Marketing Manager at Red Hat, discusses Apache Kafka</li>
<li>Agenda: explain use case, show demo of IOT scenario, and answer questions</li>
<li>Apache Kafka is a distributed system for handling continuously stream data, highly available, scalable, and fault tolerant</li>
<li>Use case: Kafka handles large amount of data ingestion in realtime, such as IoT devices producing data streams</li>
<li>Realtime analysis and event driven architecture are key features</li>
<li>Kafka instance consists of brokers, topics, partitions, producers, and consumers</li>
<li>Topic is a data flow; typically divided into multiple partitions</li>
<li>Producer sends message to topic, which is distributed across brokers<ul>
<li>Partition replication ensures high availability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consumer consumes partition, allowing massive parallel consumption of data</li>
<li>Kafka offers APIs for producers, consumers, and admin functions</li>
<li>Kafka Stream API allows building applications that produce new stream data from existing data</li>
<li>Kafka Connect API integrates external systems with Kafka</li>
<li>Source: takes data from external system and creates Kafka event streams</li>
<li>Sink: consumes messages from Kafka topics and pushes data to external systems</li>
<li>Red Hat OpenShift Streams is a managed Apache Kafka service</li>
<li>IOT devices often use MQTT protocol, which can be bridged with Apache Camel to Kafka</li>
<li>Kafka can enrich raw IoT data with static data from databases using Kafka Connect and Division</li>
<li>GraphQL query language and runtime can be used to define queries and visualize data from Kafka and external systems</li>
<li>Demonstration using a smart parking meter dataset in Los Angeles, where MQTT messages are sent from the meters and consumed by Kafka, enriched, aggregated, and presented through a GraphQL UI.</li>

<li>Quarkus has a smaller memory footprint and faster startup time than Spring</li>
<li>Eric gave examples of how to use Quarkus with Spring technologies like JAX-RS, JPA, and CDI</li>
<li>Quarkus has built-in support for event-driven architecture and cloud native deployment</li>
<li>Quarkus's event bus is built on top of Eclipse Vert.x</li>
<li>Quarkus doesn't require a separate database for each microservice like Spring does</li>
<li>Quarkus has a simpler way of handling unit tests compared to Spring</li>
<li>Quarkus uses the Reactive programming model, but it doesn't force you to write reactive code</li>
<li>Quarkus supports native image generation and containerized deployment</li>
<li>Quarkus has a smaller community than Spring, but it's growing quickly</li>
<li>Eric encouraged the audience to explore Quarkus and give it a try.</li>

<ul>
<li>Michael from StackRock, now Red Hat, presenting on Cubelinter, an open-source tool for enforcing Kubernetes configuration checks</li>
<li>Tool helps create production-ready YAML files by focusing on best practices and enforcing specific policies</li>
<li>Cubelinter is a CLI tool designed to be developer-friendly and lightweight, with a simple setup process</li>
<li>It can be used in a continuous integration (CI) pipeline as part of the development workflow</li>
<li>Different use cases have different policy configurations; for example, a highly available application may require three pods instead of one</li>
<li>The tool has over 40 policies and can be customized to fit specific needs</li>
<li>It integrates with GitHub Actions and other CI tools to automate checks and provide feedback in real time</li>
<li>The community is actively contributing to the project, and new features are being added regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The speaker goes on to give a detailed demonstration of how Cubelinter can be used to identify and fix configuration issues in Kubernetes YAML files, using various examples and use cases. They also discuss some advanced features like custom checks, annotation handling, and integrating with GitHub Actions for automated testing and feedback. The presentation concludes with a call to action for the audience to try out Cubelinter and contribute to the project if they are interested.</p>

<ul>
<li>Welcome to another tech talk</li>
<li>Last time, there was a DNS issue that wasn't an issue with Kafka</li>
<li>Today's topic: Processing telemetry event streams in Apache Kafka using the Kafka Streams API</li>
<li>Kafka is a popular open source distributed event streaming platform for building high availability and scalable data pipelines</li>
<li>A cluster is composed of brokers, which are logical groupings of events called topics</li>
<li>Topics can be sharded and partitioned for horizontal scaling and replicated across multiple brokers for fault tolerance</li>
<li>Producers write data to specific partitions based on keys, and consumers can read from multiple partitions in parallel</li>
<li>Kafka Streams API allows building stream processing applications by implementing stateful transformations and aggregations on data streams</li>
<li>Demo: A video game telemetry application using Apache Kafka and the Kafka Streams API to process real-time player data for a multiplayer game running on OpenShift across multiple cloud regions.</li>
<li>Players connect to the game server, which emits events when they take turns and shoot each other</li>
<li>Kafka Streams processes these events in real time to update the game state, which is stored in a state store and displayed in a web application</li>
<li>The demo uses OpenShift to manage the Kafka cluster and deploy the game server and aggregation application across multiple cloud regions for low latency and high availability.</li>

<li>Bernard Tyson from Red Hat presenting on using Kafka for application messaging and outbox pattern</li>
<li>Kafka is a popular open source event streaming platform, used for moving large amounts of data between systems</li>
<li>Managed Kafka service provided by Red Hat for streamlined developer experience</li>
<li>Outbox pattern discussed to handle dual writes (updating two systems with one transaction)</li>
<li>Order Service persists order and message in Kafka instead of sending message directly</li>
<li>Change event describes instance, transformed before sending to Kafka</li>
<li>Demonstration includes spinning up a Kafka cluster, creating a topic, and using the outbox pattern for an order service</li>
<li>Uses a PostgreSQL database for the order data</li>
<li>Connects to the Kafka service via OpenShift, with automatic injection of Kafka details into the application</li>
<li>Kafka Connect used for change data capture (CDC), with a Source Connector for ingesting data from a database and transforming it into Kafka messages. TheSink Connector is used to push data to a sink, such as a database or another topic.</li>
<li>Outbox pattern allows for eventual consistency (updating one system first, then the other based on the change event) instead of trying to perform dual writes in one transaction.</li>

<ul>
<li>Alex Soto Bueno will talk about security in Istio, a service mesh for microservices architecture.</li>
<li>Monolith applications used to be single database and big, now microservices have several services interconnected, each with its own database and entry point.</li>
<li>Service architecture uses multiple services instead of monolith applications for easier deployments.</li>
<li>Microservices communicate over the network, so they need to be made resilient against failures and attacks.</li>
<li>Istio helps make microservice architectures secure by covering service discovery, authentication, traffic management, and monitoring.</li>
<li>Istio uses sidecar containers that intercept network traffic to manage and secure it. It can encrypt, reroute, or block traffic based on rules.</li>
<li>Istio also has features for managing certificates and handling authentication and authorization.</li>
<li>In the demo, Alex will use OpenShift and a customer preference application with recommendation microservices. They will register services, apply virtual services, and secure communication between them using Istio.</li>
<li>Istio can automatically encrypt internal traffic and manage certificates for http services, but it's important to check that internal communication is encrypted.</li>
<li>Istio also provides fine-grained access control and supports JSON web tokens for authentication. It validates tokens, checks issuers, and enforces policies.</li>

<li>Special day with special guest, Cedric, talking about Odo 20 and auto cloud native development on OpenShift.</li>
<li>Cedric is a Red Hat intern and Java academic student at NC State University.</li>
<li>Odo has been around since early 2019, originally called "legacy article content" and enhanced functionality with Kubernetes support.</li>
<li>The focus today is on deploying front-end and back-end applications using Odo in OpenShift.</li>
<li>Jason Dobies from the Bosch team will be watching and mentoring.</li>
<li>Dev file is a new feature in Odo 20 that allows reproducing development environments and sharing clusters in Kubernetes or OpenShift.</li>
<li>It describes the development environment, including container definitions, project cloning, predefined commands, and customization options.</li>
<li>To create a dev file, use <code>odo create &lt;nodejs|go|ruby&gt; &lt;component_name&gt;</code> command with default settings.</li>
<li>Dev files are portable and can be used to deploy applications on Kubernetes or OpenShift.</li>
<li>Odo is lightweight and streamlines the developer experience in writing, building, and deploying applications on OpenShift.</li>
<li>It supplements, not replaces, traditional <code>oc</code> tools for managing OpenShift clusters.</li>
<li>The demo will show using a generic OpenShift project and using the Visual Code Extension for faster development.</li>
<li>Dev file is a YAML file that includes metadata, build Dockerfile/deploy manifest, component list, and custom commands for debugging and testing.</li>
<li>Migrating from source image files to dev files can be done by converting the existing image using Odo utils.</li>
<li>Dev files allow easy sharing of environments between teams and customizing components with specific versions and runtime settings.</li>
<li>Using Odo 20 instead of OpenJDK is recommended for better performance and compatibility.</li>
<li>To push an application using a dev file, use <code>odo push</code> command with the utility function to convert and deploy the dev file.</li>
<li>The new version of Odo fixes many bugs and is highly recommended for improvements.</li>

<li>Intro: Sebby Blanc, Java developer and speaker, presents on building Cube CTL plugins using Quarkus.</li>
<li>Cube CTL overview: It interacts with the Kubernetes API server, is intuitive and extensible.</li>
<li>Creating Cube CTL plugins:</li>
<li>Language agnostic: Write in any language (example: Bash, Go, Python, Java).</li>
<li>Naming convention: Plugin name should start with <code>cubectl-</code>.</li>
<li>Parsing arguments: Use a library like PicoCLI to handle command line options.</li>
<li>Interacting with Kubernetes cluster: Use official Kubernetes Java client or Fabric8.</li>
<li>Compiling and running the plugin: Create a JAR file and make it executable.</li>
<li>Challenges in creating Cube CTL plugins using Java and Quarkus:</li>
<li>Parsing arguments: Need to use libraries like PicoCLI to parse command line options.</li>
<li>Interacting with Kubernetes cluster: Need up-to-date libraries, like Fabricate, to interact with the cluster.</li>
<li>Compiling and running: Need to compile the plugin as a native executable using platforms like GrowVM.</li>
<li>Java vs Quarkus: Quarkus is faster, smaller, and has more features than Java alone.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Cube CTL plugins can be created using any language with proper naming conventions and libraries. The process involves handling command line arguments, interacting with the Kubernetes cluster, and compiling and running the plugin. Challenges include using up-to-date libraries and compiling native executables. Quarkus offers improvements in speed, size, and features compared to Java alone.</li>

<li>Welcome to DevNation Tech Talk (Madrid, Spain)</li>
<li>Speaker: David Sanchez from Red Hat Services based in Spain</li>
<li>Topic: Serverless Tecton and Argo CD</li>
<li>Agenda: CI/CD workflow for serverless applications using Tecton and Argo CD</li>
<li>Overview: Use declarative approach with GitOps to manage infrastructure and applications</li>
<li>Technology involved: Tecton (Kubernetes native framework), Argo CD (GitHub's continuous delivery tool)</li>
<li>Workflow explained: 1. Continuous Integration (Tecton pipeline) 2. Continuous Delivery (Argo CD)</li>
<li>Key features of Tecton: Decouple pipelines, reduce different pipelines for deploying Kubernetes clusters, resource swapping (e.g., parameter workspace, git report registry)</li>
<li>Key features of Argo CD: Declarative GitOps approach, detects difference between desired and actual application state, provides purely declarative approach for configuration customization</li>
<li>Demo application: Quarkus (Java application with small memory footprint, fast startup time)</li>
<li>Main components: Creative Service (single object for managing multiple deployments), conflict map (prioritize properties to manage conflicts)</li>
<li>Steps in the workflow: 1. Developer pushes new change to application source (repository); 2. Tecton pipeline starts with fetching source code, unit testing, building container image; 3. Pushed change is cloned and a new revision is created; 4. Argo CD pulls configuration from repository and synchronizes existing Kubernetes objects; 5. New configuration is deployed to the cluster (manually in production); 6. Changes are detected and synced back to the GitOps repository.</li>
<li>Structure of GitOps repository: Base directory contains global server descriptor, each environment represented by a different folder for customization.</li>

<li>Welcome to Devnation Tech Talk, today we have Steve Poole presenting on Java security.</li>
<li>Steve is the author of "Seven Punicators: A Tale of Security" and has joined Red Hat this month.</li>
<li>Topic: Deep dive into specific Java security issues, not just the basics.</li>
<li>Focus will be on input validation as a pernicious problem in Java.</li>
<li>Examples will include browser form attacks, file uploads, and code injection.</li>
<li>Input validation can happen at various stages of Java code, including constructors, file system, and database queries.</li>
<li>It's important to understand that data received is potentially unreliable or dangerous, even from a REST API.</li>
<li>Common patterns for REST APIs include slash APIs and versioning, which can be exploited by attackers.</li>
<li>Attackers can also try to manipulate request methods, headers, and cookies to gain unintended access.</li>
<li>Be aware of SQL injection vulnerabilities, especially in property files or command line arguments.</li>
<li>Encryption is not foolproof, as there are always potential weaknesses that attackers can exploit.</li>
<li>Keep error messages clear and informative, as they can provide valuable information to attackers.</li>
<li>Use defense in depth, making it difficult for attackers to gain a foothold in your system.</li>
<li>Code quality is crucial, ensuring that code is not poorly written or easily exploited.</li>
<li>Encapsulation can help prevent data access within classes.</li>
<li>Be aware of state management vulnerabilities and try to control state transitions.</li>
<li>Understand the potential risks of third-party dependencies and ensure they are thoroughly tested.</li>
<li>Test your application extensively, including edge cases and error scenarios, to catch vulnerabilities early.</li>
<li>Q&amp;A: Javed asked about common pitfalls or top 10 vulnerabilities in Java security. Steve mentioned that there is a strong correlation between the OWASP Top Ten and the issues he covered in his presentation.</li>

<li>Special guest Bartosz from Zurich, Switzerland will talk about Kubernetes Telepresence and testing in production without delay.</li>
<li>He'll discuss the development process and challenges of managing containers and services in a distributed system.</li>
<li>Telepresence is a tool that allows developers to interact with real clusters without spinning up containers locally.</li>
<li>It works by rerouting traffic to the developer's machine, allowing for a native experience when developing directly in the cluster.</li>
<li>Telepresence can be used with IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ or VS Code and has features like circuit breaking, routing, and traffic splitting.</li>
<li>It's a powerful tool that enables local development while interacting with production services, but it brings certain levels of complexity due to its statefulness.</li>
<li>Telepresence is not a replacement for staging environments and can have limitations in manipulating data exposed to users.</li>
<li>It requires security enhancements and careful consideration when dealing with specific architectures or projects.</li>
<li>Installing and using Telepresence involves adding certain privileges, tweaking configurations, and using the telepresence CLI tool.</li>
<li>Telepresence is used extensively in popular projects like Istio and OpenShift and has a large community of contributors and users.</li>
<li>The talk will cover use cases, demonstrations, and best practices for using Telepresence in various scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<li>Welcome to another DevNation talk, hosted by Gunner and James Dade.</li>
<li>Today, Gunner will be discussing Quarkus serverless technology for a blog search feature in Amazon Lambda architecture.</li>
<li>Serverless means no need to provision or manage servers, focusing on deploying and scaling functional code.</li>
<li>Three reasons for using serverless: smaller attack surface, lower cost, and learning opportunity.</li>
<li>Architecture overview: static content hosted on Github Pages, search request handled by Lambda function via API Gateway and AWS Serverless Runtime Environment.</li>
<li>Implementation using Gravie (Quarkus Apache CDI) for dependency injection and lambda function implementation.</li>
<li>Three ways to implement serverless apps with Quarkus: 1) using Java and the Lambda Request Handler interface, 2) using Funq (Caucus umbrella), and 3) using a familiar web stack like Vert.x and RestEasy.</li>
<li>Benefits of serverless include faster startup times and optimized memory usage.</li>
<li>Challenges include dealing with external dependencies and construct support in Gravie.</li>
<li>Using an extension like Clockwork to handle method binding and substitution attribute factory.</li>
<li>Building a deployable function package with a ZIP file, containing the search index and API Command Line Tool (AWS CLI).</li>
<li>Using AWS Make to easily deploy Lambda functions and infrastructure.</li>
<li>Important considerations include cost control and security measures like budget circuits and identity access management.</li>

<ul>
<li>Welcome to DevNation, Daniel Grimm will talk about hacking Istio service mesh using WebAssembly</li>
<li>Dan is a member of the issue team at Red Hat, talks about extending Istio with WebAssembly</li>
<li>Service mesh like Istio helps avoid cascading failures and provides observability across infrastructure</li>
<li>It performs tasks such as load balancing and circuit breaking</li>
<li>Infrastructure might use heterogeneous languages but service mesh makes it behave consistently</li>
<li>Envoy delivers functionality through a listener, network filter, and HTTP filter</li>
<li>Filter chain in Envoy: incoming request -&gt; b c filter -&gt; cbna (simple model)</li>
<li>Three types of filters: listener, connection, and network/HTTP</li>
<li>Listener filters decide which filter to use based on the traffic</li>
<li>Network/HTTP filters read and write encrypted data, decrypt traffic, and handle routing decisions</li>
<li>HDP filters act at layer 7 and understand HTTP request semantics</li>
<li>WebAssembly is a near-native bytecode format with a lightweight isolation model</li>
<li>Istio developers are adopting WebAssembly for its simplicity and ease of integration with Envoy.</li>

<li>Welcome to another deaf nation Tech Talk, where secrets are revealed. Today's guest is Alex Soto from Red Hat. He will be talking about community secrets and how they are used in Kubernetes based applications.</li>
<li>Secrets can include user information, database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data. They should be kept secret for a long time and protected with encryption.</li>
<li>Examples of secrets include passwords found in songs, such as "Symphony number eight" by Franz Schubert, which contains a bagmask message.</li>
<li>Secrets can be stored in various ways, such as environment variables, files, or databases. They should not be stored in plain text and should be encrypted for added security.</li>
<li>Alex will demonstrate how to create secrets using Kubernetes and how they are used in applications. He will also discuss best practices for storing and managing secrets.</li>
<li>Attackers can gain access to secrets by exploiting vulnerabilities or through social engineering tactics. It is important to keep secrets secure and to rotate them regularly.</li>
<li>Alex recommends using a secret manager, such as Hashicorp Vault, to store and manage secrets securely. He also suggests using encryption and multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security.</li>
<li>Encryption algorithms, such as AES-256, can be used to protect secrets both at rest and in transit. Access to encrypted data should be limited to authorized users only.</li>
<li>Kubernetes Secrets can be injected into containers using various methods, including environment variables, volumes, or ConfigMaps. This allows applications to access the sensitive information they need without exposing it directly.</li>
<li>It is important to keep secrets out of version control systems and to use secure communication channels when transferring them between systems.</li>
<li>Alex will demonstrate how to create and manage Kubernetes Secrets using various methods, including YAML files and the kubectl command line tool. He will also discuss best practices for deploying and managing Secret objects in a cluster.</li>
<li>Attackers can gain access to secrets by exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure or by using social engineering tactics to trick users into revealing them. It is important to keep secrets secure and to rotate them regularly to minimize the risk of compromise.</li>
<li>Alex will also discuss how to use Kubernetes Secrets to encrypt data at rest and in transit, as well as how to manage access to sensitive data using RBAC rules and other security features.</li>

<li>Welcome to another Deaf Nation Live session</li>
<li>Topic: Using Apache Kafka for Serverless Screen Processing with Change Data Events (CDEs) and the division data event facility</li>
<li>Presenter: Matthias Jansen, Red Hat</li>
<li>Agenda: Overview of solution, architecture, use case, enrichment, processing, deployment, and scaling</li>
<li>Solution: Enabling temperature measurement streaming using Apache Kafka, with change capture tool to read database logs and enrich data from master data</li>
<li>Architecture: Running inside a Kubernetes cluster, using the Kafka connect operator for easy operation</li>
<li>Use case: Stream temperature measurement coming from a source (similar to network temperature sensor), which is enriched with master data (like station location) and routed to different consumers</li>
<li>Enrichment: Impose database contains master data (weather measurement station, using a tool like Jeebies IAM change capture tool to tap transaction log), extracting and enriching data into another Kafka topic (using a Java-based API)</li>
<li>Processing: Real-time processing of the stream using a Java-based API runtime, with cooperative multithreading for efficient processing</li>
<li>Deployment: Easy deployment using Kubernetes OpenShift, making it accessible to everyone through a web application with an interactive map display</li>
<li>Scaling: Using Kafka connect operators and Casca connector, handling different consumer parts and load balancing</li>
<li>Tools used: Kafka, Kafka Connect, GitHub, Java, YAML, Apache Netty, CDI, etc.</li>
<li>Q&amp;A session will follow presenter's talk</li>

<ul>
<li>Host introduces topic: dealing with inconsistent state in Java programming</li>
<li>Common mistake: null pointer exception caused by unexpected variable state</li>
<li>Goal of talk: increasing state consistency, using immutable collections as an example</li>
<li>Personal experience: hardest bug to fix was a null pointer exception due to an unexpected variable state</li>
<li>Immutability: best way to deal with inconsistent state, taming different collection implementations worldwide</li>
<li>Eclipse Collection: nice API for providing immutable collections</li>
<li>Designing immutable classes: ensure all fields are final, use private constructor, provide factory method</li>
<li>Preconditions: checking arguments before creating objects ensures consistent state</li>
<li>Using JPA and Hibernate: designing immutable classes doesn't mean they can't provide immutability; minimize mutability instead</li>
<li>Avoiding primitive obsession: create types instead of using primitives for rich domain models</li>
<li>Creating an Order class: exposing a completely mutable class vs an immutable one, using JPA entity to enforce state consistency</li>
<li>Designing an OrderNumber class: providing constraint helper methods inside</li>
<li>Importance of table names: no order info reserved keyword conflicts</li>
<li>Using an embeddable value object: enforcing conditions to prevent duplicates and inconsistent state</li>
<li>Creating a Money class: using a private final big decimal for the value, creating a factory method to ensure immutability</li>
<li>Designing a MoneyAttributeConverter: breaking encapsulation to allow RPE cleaner access, providing proper information hiding</li>
<li>Exposing an Order class using JSON: add validation annotations and provide getters/setters for JSON data</li>
<li>Using a Precondition class: check arguments before creating objects and use the J framework for awareness</li>
<li>Eclipse Collection vs Modifiable List: using an immutable wrapper to create a modifiable list, performance considerations don't matter much</li>
<li>Internationalization: using ResourceBundle for different error messages</li>
<li>Conclusion: Java community deserves celebration on its 25th anniversary.</li>

<li>Welcome to DevNation conference, Bilgi Ibrahim will speak about how kubernetes is evolving and its impact on future technology.</li>
<li>Bilgi has worked as a consultant and architect for Red Hat for many years, contributed to Apache Camel, wrote books on integration and kubernetes.</li>
<li>Topics: Microservices, Life cycle management, Networking, State abstraction.</li>
<li>Setting the framework: Evaluating various technologies to build services, need capabilities like deployment, rollback, configuration management, resource isolation, networking, state management, etc.</li>
<li>Kubernetes satisfies most of these needs: Health checks (liveness and readiness), intelligent placement, declarative deployment, configuration management, resource isolation, etc.</li>
<li>Kubernetes provides a platform for extending its functionality with sidecar operators, service meshes, native components, etc.</li>
<li>Sidecar operators allow adding capabilities transparently, like data plane operators, operator patterns, etc.</li>
<li>Service mesh (Istio) adds network and observability capabilities, handles service discovery, dynamic traffic routing, security, etc.</li>
<li>Kubernetes Native (Canadian) provides eventing infrastructure and serverless characteristics.</li>
<li>Dapper is a portable runtime with sidecar sets that can manage state and interactions between services.</li>
<li>Predictions for future architecture: More focus on lifecycle management, operator innovation, polyglot architecture, etc.</li>

<li>Joffrey Desmet to present AI tech talk about Java, focusing on scheduling problem in hospital setting due to pandemic.</li>
<li>Special constraints arise such as need for respiratory specialist, nurse availability, and sleep requirements.</li>
<li>Planning solution assigns shift based on constraint satisfaction, with some constraints being hard (unfeasible) or soft (desirable but not required).</li>
<li>Planning uses recorded constraint history to improve planning over time.</li>
<li>Optimal solution avoids migration of staff between wards as much as possible while balancing workload and respecting constraints.</li>
<li>Planner also takes into account employee inoculation status, which can be used to minimize risk while still assigning shifts effectively.</li>
<li>Planning algorithm uses a replicating constraint solver for efficiency and scalability.</li>
<li>Employee availability screen shows color-coded availability (red for unavailable, green for available).</li>
<li>AI planning allows for faster and more accurate scheduling compared to manual methods.</li>
<li>Planner can handle large numbers of shifts and employees efficiently.</li>
<li>Constraint streaming allows the planner to react quickly to changes in constraints or employee availability.</li>

<li>Welcome to Ansible Tech Talk with Adam Miller, Ansible expert from Red Hat.</li>
<li>Ansible is an automation tool that can handle both configuration management and command control tasks.</li>
<li>It's capable of managing physical hardware, networking devices, firewalls, and more.</li>
<li>Ansible uses the concept of 'playbooks', which define a sequence of tasks to be executed on a target system or group of systems.</li>
<li>Inventory refers to the list of hosts or systems that Ansible will manage. It can be in various formats including YAML, JSON, or INI.</li>
<li>Ansible has a rich ecosystem of plugins, including for different inventory sources and connection methods.</li>
<li>Ansible is often used for DevOps workflows, but it's also useful for non-native tasks and infrastructure glue.</li>
<li>Adam will be demonstrating how to use Ansible to install packages on a Linux system, using the 'ansible-playbook' command and the 'hosts' file. He will also cover dynamic inventory and variable definitions.</li>
<li>Ansible can interact with various cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, and it supports different connection plugins for each provider.</li>
<li>Adam encourages people to check out the advanced resources available on ansible.com and reach out if they have any questions or need help.</li>

<li>Welcome to Another Deaf Nation Live</li>
<li>New platform for excellent content and presentations</li>
<li>Edison Naga introducing topic: Distributed Data, specifically event sourcing</li>
<li>Focus on securing event sourcing in modern systems</li>
<li>History of data management: from XML files to Hibernate annotations to event sourcing</li>
<li>Hibernate was popular around 2005 and replaced XML with hibernate.cfg.xml file</li>
<li>Event sourcing discussed around 15 years ago as a solution for complex systems</li>
<li>Overview of event scene, where events represent behavior data in a system instead of structure data</li>
<li>Discussion on the challenges of distributing data securely using event sourcing</li>
<li>Need to handle performance, availability, and consistency issues<ul>
<li>Performance: ensure endpoints can perform well, need to minimize latency</li>
<li>Availability: ensure that data is available at all times, need to implement fallback strategies</li>
<li>Consistency: manage conflicts between different teams or services working on the same data<ul>
<li>Strong consistency means no conflict ever happens</li>
<li>Eventual consistency allows for eventual conflicts and requires versioning and schema compatibility</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proposed solutions for securing event sourcing include using message brokers like Apache Kafka, applying CDC (Change Data Capture), and implementing synchronous event propagation.</li>
<li>Importance of understanding the tradeoffs between different architectures and choosing the right one for specific use cases.</li>

<li>Two experts from Red Hat to discuss modular design for monolithic applications and preventing the evolution into 'big ball mud'</li>
<li>Eric Murphy: architect, modernizing legacy monolith apps, building microservices, open source technology advocate, author of blog</li>
<li>Bert Sutter: developer, focuses on application development, helping customers with AI/ML, modular architecture, maintainer of a blog</li>
<li>Discussion on applying modularity to monolithic applications and the concept of 'big ball mud' - unregulated growth, repeated expedient repair, information shared promiscuously among disparate elements</li>
<li>Proposed flavors of application modularity: source control, build, data, deployment</li>
<li>Source control modularity: multiple git repositories, one large app allows for scale and separation</li>
<li>Build modularity: separate projects, publish artifact repository (Nexus)</li>
<li>Data modularity: tight coupling, shared database schema, separation of concerns</li>
<li>Deployment modularity: deploy multiple microservices instead of one application, interservice communication, event propagation using network transport, client UI utilizes multiple services potentially with API aggregator</li>
<li>Demo of Instagram-like simple application modeled with modular design (photo gallery)</li>
<li>Event-driven architecture</li>
<li>Three microservices: photo service, query service, storage service</li>
<li>Service communicates via message broker</li>
<li>Each microservice has its own dedicated storage and database schema</li>
<li>User creates a new photo sends a POST request to photo service, information is stored in database and published to message broker</li>
<li>User adds a like to a photo sends a POST request to like service, counter is incremented and new message is published to message broker</li>
<li>Modularity principles: code modularity, data modularity, source control modularity, build modularity, deployment modularity</li>
<li>Code modularity: decoupled communication via message broker, data modularity: dedicated data store accessing only own data</li>
<li>Demonstration of photo gallery application built with modularity practices using Eclipse and multiple git repositories</li>
<li>Microservices approach: deploy service independently, update independently, organize development teams differently, scale development teams differently.</li>
<li>Scalability concerns in monolithic applications and microservices approach</li>
<li>Benefits of monolithic deployment: easier to develop, data centralization, single API endpoint, simpler communication between components</li>
<li>Disadvantages of monolithic deployment: less flexibility for scaling, potential downsides of distributed systems (unreliable network communication)</li>
<li>Question and answer session covers memory concerns in microservices vs. monolithic applications, UUID as a solution to data sharing issues, and the decision between monolithic and microservice architecture.</li>

<li>Welcome to another Dead Nation presentation about Reactive programming using Quercus</li>
<li>Clement Kofi, software engineer, will discuss building web applications with Quercus</li>
<li>Quercus is a fullstack Java environment that provides fast start times and low memory consumption</li>
<li>It's based on libraries like Vert.x, Hibernate, and CDI</li>
<li>Reactive programming means reacting to message stimuli instead of writing code in an isochronous manner</li>
<li>Spreadsheet example: observing a cell inside a spreadsheet and updating another way by building an event loop with callbacks or using actors</li>
<li>Quercus unifies reactive and single stateless components</li>
<li>Reactive manifesto defined in 2014, focuses on responsiveness and distributed systems that exchange messages for processing</li>
<li>Imperative programming involves developer control while reactive programming depends on message stimuli to control flow</li>
<li>Quercus provides a way to write asynchronous code using operators and composing programs using the operator pipeline</li>
<li>Virtual address is used for elasticity, which handles load balancing and failover automatically</li>
<li>Circuit breaker pattern protects against failure cascades in distributed systems</li>
<li>Request/Reply vs message streaming: message streaming allows decoupling of components and asynchronous processing</li>
<li>Quackers provides an HTTP messaging system for all-in-one use, but it's recommended to separate concerns using different technologies</li>
<li>Starbucks example: traditional coffee shop vs microservices architecture</li>
<li>Asynchronous microservices allow for more responsive handling of requests without blocking</li>
<li>Quercus provides a reactive messaging library and supports stream annotations for easier implementation</li>
<li>Reggie programming is a type of reactive programming based on data flow pipelines and event processing</li>
<li>Use cases include financial trading systems, real-time analytics, and chat applications.</li>

<li>Welcome to Kafka and OpenShift Tech Talk</li>
<li>Paulo, IOT expert from Reddit, will be speaking about using Apache Kafka for IOT solutions</li>
<li>Apache Kafka is a traditional messaging solution used in IOT applications</li>
<li>Sensor cloud solution provides raw data from devices, which is ingested and turned into intelligence</li>
<li>Data goes through a pyramid of information: raw data -&gt; processed data -&gt; knowledge -&gt; wisdom</li>
<li>Use realtime analytics to get realtime reaction to events</li>
<li>Stream processing allows handling of unbounded data sets and realtime analytics</li>
<li>Apache Kafka has a stream API for realtime data streaming and analytics</li>
<li>Apache Kafka is horizontally scalable, fault tolerant, and can handle high throughput/low latency requirements</li>
<li>Use Kafka Connect to manage data ingestion from various sources</li>
<li>Apache Kafka provides a commit log for distributed transactions</li>
<li>Use Kafka Streams API for stream processing instead of Spark Streaming to avoid the need for another cluster</li>
<li>Kafka can be used with traditional messaging protocols like MQTT and NTP</li>
<li>Discussed use case of using a gateway between IOT devices and cloud services for translation and offloading processing</li>
<li>Gateways can also handle security, reduce network traffic, and provide local processing capabilities when devices are offline.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker is part of Red Hat and works on the AMQ messaging product.</li>
<li>JMS (Java Message Service) has been around for a long time and influential in messaging landscape, especially in enterprise software development.</li>
<li>JMS introduced important concepts like multiple connections, sessions, and message topics/queues.</li>
<li>One major improvement in JMS 2 was the introduction of persistent send operations and asynchronous communication, making messaging more efficient.</li>
<li>API improvements like accessing payload messages directly without casting made writing reliable applications easier.</li>
<li>ActiveMQ (popular open-source messaging server) uses JMS for messaging and has a new architecture called Artemis, which supports asynchronous operations and is designed for modern event-driven applications.</li>
<li>Docker and Kubernetes have changed the deployment environment, making it easier to deploy lightweight applications using messaging technologies like JMS.</li>
<li>The speaker will demonstrate using JMS and Kubernetes in an example application.</li>
<li>The example application uses two technologies together: a REST API (JAX-RS) for external access and JMS for internal communication within the cluster.</li>
<li>The speaker will use Docker, MiniCube, and Kubernetes to set up and deploy the example application.</li>
<li>The sender service sends messages asynchronously using JMS to an Artemis broker, which the receiver service consumes using JMS and HTTP.</li>
<li>The presentation covers various topics like building a Docker image, exposing services inside and outside of the cluster, and handling reconnects and failovers.</li>
<li>The speaker also discusses some advanced concepts like AMQP routing and high availability in Artemis deployments.</li>

<li>Rachel Laylock from Thoughtworks talks about her experience helping a large financial enterprise adopt continuous delivery</li>
<li>Client had slow release cycles and was struggling to make monthly hotfixes</li>
<li>The team spent long hours during weekends trying to deploy hotfixes, requiring everyone involved</li>
<li>The project failed despite significant investment in continuous delivery tools and practices</li>
<li>Reasons for failure: codebase was huge and complex, with 70 million lines of code and a messy dependency architecture</li>
<li>Continuous delivery required not just automating deployment but also addressing issues related to operationalization of software, including data management, configuration management, continuous integration, quality assurance, release management, and potentially changing organizational structures</li>
<li>The team learned a lot since the initial failure, with a focus on creating a platform that supports self-service deployment and enables independent scaling, while also maintaining cohesion and avoiding coupling issues.</li>

<li>Apache Kafka is a popular messaging system, known for its scalability and fault tolerance.</li>
<li>Kafka topics are split into partitions, which allow parallel consumption and horizontal scaling.</li>
<li>Partition assignment can be based on message key or round-robin distribution.</li>
<li>Retention policy determines how long data is kept in Kafka before being deleted.</li>
<li>Consumers use offsets to keep track of the position in a topic partition.</li>
<li>Kafka offers features like rebalancing and consumer locking for handling consumer group management.</li>
<li>Kafka can be run on various platforms, including OpenShift and Kubernetes.</li>
<li>Traditional message brokers (like ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ) store messages in memory, while Kafka stores them on disk, allowing for better scalability and performance.</li>
<li>Kafka supports streaming data processing with its Streams API and can be used for various use cases like data integration, metric collection, and log aggregation.</li>
<li>Under the hood, Kafka relies on a distributed storage mechanism to manage and store messages efficiently.</li>
<li>Kafka clusters can handle high throughput and are not dependent on dedicated storage networks.</li>
<li>Consumers in a consumer group read from their assigned partitions and commit their progress back to Kafka.</li>
<li>Consumers can be assigned to different partitions based on the consumer group ID or by using consumer locks for rebalancing.</li>
<li>Synchronous producers can wait for message delivery acknowledgement before continuing, while asynchronous producers do not block for a response.</li>
<li>Kafka's replay feature allows consumers to reprocess messages if needed, which is useful for handling out-of-order or incorrectly processed messages.</li>

<ul>
<li>Presenter: Edson Onaga</li>
<li>Topic: Feature toggle hypothesis-driven development</li>
<li>Goal: Discuss feature toggles and hypotheses in the context of continuous delivery, especially as a solution to the "deployment problem" in software development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous delivery is about fully automated software deployment pipelines.</li>
<li>The goal is to reduce risk by testing business hypotheses before production releases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hypothesis-driven development vs traditional pipeline approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the traditional pipeline approach, it's assumed that the next version will be better than the previous one.</li>
<li>This can lead to wasted time and resources on features that might not be useful in production.</li>
<li>In hypothesis-driven development, small plates (features) are cooked separately based on user feedback.</li>
<li>The user decides which feature they prefer and the resource is allocated accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feature toggles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A feature toggle is a flag that can be turned on or off to test different features in production.</li>
<li>This allows teams to implement two different approaches and compare their performance without having to merge branches.</li>
<li>The advantage of using feature toggles is that it makes it easier to switch between implementations if one performs better than the other.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Demo:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two demos were presented, one using FF4j with Java and another using Go Z.</li>
<li>Both demos involved using feature toggles to test different recommendations in production.</li>
<li>The goal was to compare the performance of two different recommendation engines and choose the better one based on user feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Feature toggles are a useful tool for hypothesis-driven development, especially in the context of continuous delivery.</li>
<li>They allow teams to test different approaches in production and switch between them if one performs better than the other.</li>
<li>The importance of monitoring performance and measuring meaningful metrics was emphasized.</li>

<li>Welcome to another Dead Nation Live session in New York City</li>
<li>Today's topic: Tracing Key Technology - Distributed Microservices</li>
<li>Speakers are Pablo and Joseph from Red Hat, working on Kyani project</li>
<li>Problem: In a microservice architecture, it's hard to figure out which version of the service was affected by a request</li>
<li>Term: Observability</li>
<li>System is observable if you can collect metrics, see logs, and analyze tracing information</li>
<li>Solution: Tracing</li>
<li>Code mutation with explicit instrumentation</li>
<li>Tracing techniques: cold instrumentation, distributed context propagation</li>
<li>Tracing code vs business code</li>
<li>Increase instrumentation for better visibility</li>
<li>Java uses byte code manipulation or runtime agents for tracing</li>
<li>Popular frameworks include OpenTracing, Micrometer, and Zipkin</li>
<li>Tracing in a microservice road: each service needs individual tracing window</li>
<li>Context propagation: passing correlation ID to trace the request across services</li>
<li>Google's Pepper project was an early solution, now many vendors offer this capability</li>
<li>End of presentation, open for questions.</li>

<li>Apologies for international crowd, 25-minute presentation with Q&amp;A session to follow</li>
<li>Camel: open source integration framework for building enterprise applications, used since 9 years</li>
<li>Camel allows integration of different systems using common components and Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP)</li>
<li>EIP: message routing, transformation, error handling, etc.</li>
<li>Camel is lightweight, can run everywhere from traditional servers to cloud containers</li>
<li>Camel is flexible and versatile for integrating various APIs, databases, messaging systems, web services, etc.</li>
<li>Camel can transform data structures like XML, JSON, CSV, flat files, etc.</li>
<li>Camel supports distributed computing and can integrate legacy systems with mainframes and FTP file systems</li>
<li>Q: What's the best way to run Camel in a cloud container? A: Use the latest webinar presentation by Merced for more details, borrowed slide from Bill.</li>
<li>Camel is used for integration between microservices, which have become increasingly popular as applications have moved towards a containerized and distributed architecture</li>
<li>Running Camel in a container makes it easier to manage and scale services, as they can be run on different hosts and communicate over networks</li>
<li>Camel Cloud: Red Hat brings additional capabilities like CI/CD pipelines, centralized logging, and monitoring for running Camel applications in a container.</li>
<li>Camel allows easy integration of APIs, databases, and other systems using connector components</li>
<li>Camel can be used to connect APIGateway and small embedded devices</li>
<li>Agile Integration: Red Hat Middleware team coined the term for distributed integration, which is the bread and butter of Camel</li>
<li>Camel supports stateless microservices and provides mechanisms like configuration management (conflict maps) and fault tolerance (circuit breakers) to handle external dependencies and failures.</li>

<ul>
<li>Welcome to Dead Nation Live, Edson Naga speaking on zero downtime database migration in cloud native world.</li>
<li>Database administrators used to hunt and kill databases, but now it's about transitioning smoothly with DevOps practices.</li>
<li>Migration manually is no longer an option, automate everything.</li>
<li>Bluegreen deployment: two identical production environments, one running the old version, other the new.<ul>
<li>Single requirement: both versions must be back compatible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Database migration methods: set statements, DDL scripts, flyway, etc.<ul>
<li>Sharding can help with large migrations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Common challenges include column renames, data migration, and state handling.<ul>
<li>Column rename: 4 steps - add new column, read old data, copy to new table, delete old column.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Migration strategy: always keep databases back compatible with previous versions for safe production releases.</li>
<li>Demo using a Wildfly Swarm project with a customer class and database migration using Flyway.<ul>
<li>Adding a new column, renaming a column, and updating the application accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Important to keep both versions running during the migration process.</li>
<li>Using a separate migration file for each version update can help keep things organized and ensure compatibility.</li>

<li>Rafael is speaking from a hotel room in Brasilia, Brazil. He's originally from Brazil but now lives in Orlando, Florida.</li>
<li>Rafael will be discussing Docker and how it relates to Java and cgroups.</li>
<li>Container technology started around 2000 with FreeBSD, LXC, etc. JVM and container kernel future came later.</li>
<li>Rafael is using a machine with 1GB RAM for his Java application and another machine with 8GB RAM as the Docker host.</li>
<li>He's trying to limit the Java application inside the Docker container to use only 100MB memory, but the container is using 1GB of RAM on the host even when it's restricted to 50MB of swap.</li>
<li>The problem might be related to JVM not being aware of the container's memory limit in the Linux kernel's cgroups.</li>
<li>Rafael suggests checking the Java log container for any error messages, as well as the Docker container logs and system logs on both machines.</li>
<li>He also recommends trying different Linux distributions or Java versions to see if the problem persists.</li>
<li>The history of containers includes FreeBSD (2000), LXC (2006), Docker (2013), JVM (2000), etc.</li>

<li>Clemens from Vertex team will talk about reactive programming and system architecture</li>
<li>Reactive system: responding to stimulus, creating controlled response</li>
<li>Reactive vs. synchronous systems: reacting to stimuli instead of waiting for it</li>
<li>Reactive system architecture: message driven interaction, elasticity, scalability</li>
<li>Reactive programming: asynchronous, nonblocking I/O, event driven</li>
<li>Examples: HTTP server, database interaction, spreadsheet calculations</li>
<li>Difference between reactive and corrective programming: reaction vs. response to errors</li>
<li>Challenges in implementing reactive systems: synchronous development models, IO blocking</li>
<li>Benefits of using reactive programming: improved responsiveness, reduced complexity</li>
<li>Tools and libraries: Akka, Pure Actor Model, Rector, Spring, Project Reactor</li>
<li>Comparison to traditional approaches: event loop, minimum number of threads, concurrency model.</li>

<li>Welcome to another Dead Nation Live presentation</li>
<li>Gallagher will deep dive into Big Data</li>
<li>Definition: Big Data is a term for technologies and ideas used to process large amounts of data</li>
<li>Challenges include real time streaming and offline processing</li>
<li>Memory data grids are a solution for managing distributed data in real time</li>
<li>Distributed cache, SQL databases, and continuous queries are techniques used in memory data grids</li>
<li>Two use cases: event driven computation and data analytics</li>
<li>Event driven computation allows real time processing of data with advanced APIs</li>
<li>Data analytics involves using Hadoop integration for powerful processing</li>
<li>No context: mention of Jupyter Notebook and OpenShift environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The presenter goes on to give a live demo using a train transport system as an example, but the context provided does not allow for a summary of that part of the presentation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Presenter: Christian Posta, Red Hat guru for cloud native and microservice architecture, specifically around Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift.</li>
<li>Topic: Discussing the technology called "Sto" that changes the game for building applications.</li>
<li>Agenda: Microservices, service mesh, dependency management, organization, service discovery, resilience, load balancing, retries, timeouts, circuit breaking, etc.</li>
<li>Microservices: Faster change and less organizational complexity.</li>
<li>Service Mesh: Decouples network communication, allows for better coordination and control of services.</li>
<li>Dependency Management: Avoiding monolithic architecture, keep implementation consistent across different frameworks/libraries.</li>
<li>Service Discovery: Different components interact within the cluster.</li>
<li>Resilience: Dealing with timeouts, cascading failures, rate limiting, circuit breaking, etc.</li>
<li>Control Plane (Envoy proxy): Enforcing policies, getting telemetry, deciding access/interactions between services within budgets.</li>
<li>Data Plane: Interacting with different services, sending back telemetry, handling routing rules, applying traffic management.</li>
<li>Security: Managing security without the application's knowledge, mutual authentication, etc.</li>
<li>Deployment: Kubernetes, sidecar containers, etc.</li>
<li>Control Traffic: Routing, rate limiting, circuit breaking, etc.</li>
<li>Service Mesh (Envoy proxy): Allowing fine-grain control of traffic within a cluster.</li>
<li>Architectural Distributed Diagram: App defined and running on Kubernetes, using SEO control, injecting sidecar proxies for data plane communication.</li>
<li>Routing Rules: Surgically routing traffic to different versions of services or specific users.</li>
<li>Canary Deployment: Testing new versions with a fraction of the traffic before rolling out to everyone.</li>
<li>Network Security: Firewalls, network policy implementation, etc.</li>
<li>Service Mesh (Envoy proxy): Enforcing policies at the application layer instead of the network level.</li>
<li>New Innovations: Cilium project for kernel-level processing and filtering, continuing evolution in the open source world.</li>
<li>Upstream/Downstream: Open source world, upstream meaning open source software that's being productized by companies like Red Hat, downstream meaning enterprise software built on top of that open source software.</li>
<li>Sidecar Proxy Service: Taking care of service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaking, tracing, microservices capabilities, etc.</li>
<li>Camel: Integrating with Apache Camel for advanced message transformation and orchestration, etc.</li>
<li>Drawbacks: ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) conceived and implemented in a different way, still done but not exactly the same as service mesh.</li>
<li>Logging: Request level telemetry, number of request calls, circuit breakers, logging application logs, etc.</li>
<li>Questions:</li>
<li>Pete: Concept around manipulating firewalls, iptables, and networking standpoint in SEO approach.</li>
<li>Marcel: Mention of Fluentd for integrating logging in OpenShift/Kubernetes and aggregating elasticsearch data.</li>

<li>Welcome to Dev Nation live session</li>
<li>Special guest: Rafael Benevides, Director of Developer Experience at Red Hat</li>
<li>Focus on Java developers using Kubernetes</li>
<li>Benefits of running Java applications inside containers include simplifying development and enabling microservices architecture</li>
<li>Overview of Kubernetes project: an orchestrator for managing containerized applications</li>
<li>Manages machines and focuses on application deployment</li>
<li>Popular open source project with over 25,000 stars on GitHub</li>
<li>Concepts to understand: pods, services, labels</li>
<li>Pods are collections of containers in a cluster that share an IP address and environment variables</li>
<li>Services locate every pod based on label and send requests to them</li>
<li>Demonstration using Kubernetes commands (Cube CTL) and Docker</li>
<li>Deploy SQL container as pod and describe its details</li>
<li>Discuss deployment replication controller and how it keeps a desired number of replicas running</li>
<li>Create service for the SQL pod and explore how requests are sent to available replicas</li>
<li>Comparison of running a Java application with Docker vs Kubernetes commands</li>
<li>Simplified process with Kubernetes using YAML files and single command creation</li>
<li>Future topics: microservices architecture, OpenShift, and more Java workloads like Spring Boot.</li>

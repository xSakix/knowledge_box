<h2 id="lightning-talk-how-jenga-tetris-can-help-run-more-containers-with-lesser-costs-yash-bhatnager">Lightning Talk: How Jenga &amp; Tetris Can Help Run More Containers with Lesser Costs...- Yash Bhatnager</h2>
<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HatF5F4n5A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HatF5F4n5A</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The talk discusses how container scheduling in a cluster can be optimized using logic derived from classic games Jenga and Tetris.</li>
<li>Container scheduler's role is to find the optimal node for running a new container based on resource availability and predefined parameters.</li>
<li>The scheduling process involves two steps: filtering nodes based on available resources and scoring each node based on several parameters.</li>
<li>The scheduler may face challenges when available resources are insufficient or when there's fragmentation of resources in the cluster.</li>
<li>An example of a real-world scenario is a three-node system with six containers running, where one node has high CPU usage while another has low memory usage.</li>
<li>This imbalance can lead to performance degradation and potential application downtime.</li>
<li>The talk suggests using techniques like container swapping or load balancing to maintain equilibrium in the cluster and avoid sudden resource imbalances.</li>
<li>The speaker proposes using a real-time simulation of the cluster, such as a memory map, to identify the best strategy for placing containers.</li>
<li>The talk mentions that even minor optimizations can lead to significant cost savings, as shown in a test run on a Kubernetes environment where auto-scaling was reduced, saving around $5000 per month.</li>

<h2 id="lightweight-and-fast-wifi-access-in-virtual-machines-jim-huang-en-wei-wu">Lightweight and Fast WiFi Access in Virtual Machines - Jim Huang &amp; En-Wei Wu</h2>
<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIXriWKqMV0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIXriWKqMV0</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The speakers, Jim Huang and En-Wei Wu, are from National Chang Kong University in Taiwan</li>
<li>They will be talking about a lightweight solution for WiFi access in Virtual Machines (VMs) called vfi, which offers faster and easier deployment with fewer resources used compared to traditional solutions.</li>
<li>Vfi is a lightweight wireless simulator that doesn't require a complex software stack or hardware. It simulates a virtual WiFi interface.</li>
<li>The benefits of using a lightweight WiFi access solution include easier deployment in virtualized environments, reduction in resource usage, and faster performance.</li>
<li>Traditional methods for setting up WiFi connectivity involve complex software stacks that can be time-consuming and costly. Vfi eliminates the need for these complex stacks by using a lightweight software stack.</li>
<li>When running a VM with vfi, it becomes a wireless version of the driver, providing a wireless interface rather than an ethernet interface. This allows communication between VMs without the need for external hardware or drivers.</li>
<li>The vfi software stack is much simpler than traditional solutions like Hardware SIM (Harare SC), Mac l211, and the Linux kernel's WiFi simulator. It works with a smaller subset of the L21 protocol and uses less memory consumption.</li>
<li>In the data path, vfi makes use of the real device backend and Li data path for better performance. The data is transmitted directly without encapsulating it into LM1 frames.</li>
<li>Vfi maintains a table storing Mac addresses within BSS to identify whether incoming frames belong to the desired BSS, and drops those that do not. This helps improve security by preventing unwanted traffic.</li>
<li>Identifying the frame type is important for processing management frames. vfi doesn't manage management frames passed through the network protocol layer, so it identifies the type of frame and dispatches it accordingly.</li>
<li>Comparing vfi to traditional solutions like Harare SC, vfi has fewer locks and less code, making it faster and more efficient. It also uses a MIT license rather than the GPL license used by Mac l211.</li>
<li>Future work for vfi includes supporting multi-queue IO, reducing lock contention, increasing throughput, and allocating dedicated pages for reception to save time and make BFI faster.</li>

<ul>
<li>Zach Newman discusses whether large-scale automated scanning can stop malware in open source software repositories</li>
<li>He mentions his research background in applied cryptography and software repository security, specifically package signing, provenance, policy, and malware detection</li>
<li>Malware detection methods include signature-based and behavior anomaly-based approaches</li>
<li>Signature-based methods use a large list of known malware signatures to identify malicious files based on their hash values</li>
<li>Behavior anomaly-based methods monitor software behavior for suspicious activity, such as sending credit card information to foreign servers or executing remote code</li>
<li>Dynamic analysis involves running the software in a controlled environment (sandbox) to observe its behavior and detect malware</li>
<li>Static analysis examines the source code without executing it to identify potential vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Large-scale automated scanning can be effective for detecting known malware in open source software repositories, but may miss new or obfuscated threats</li>
<li>Curated community-based repositories with strict access control and review processes are more secure than open repositories where anyone can submit packages</li>
<li>False positives and false negatives are concerns with automated scanning tools</li>
<li>Human intervention is necessary for accurate malware detection and response.</li>

<ul>
<li>Marcelo Rao from IBM Research Tokyo presenting on measuring energy consumption in application clouds</li>
<li>Motivation: Climate change is impacting human activity and increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which contributes to global warming and environmental damage. Companies are looking for ways to minimize energy consumption and reduce emissions.</li>
<li>Introduction to Kepler, an open source project recently accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Sandbox that measures energy consumption at various levels in a containerized environment (container, pod, job, node).</li>
<li>Kepler uses BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter), a kernel extension that allows collecting metrics without requiring a kernel recompile, to collect power consumption data from the operating system and virtual machines.</li>
<li>Different deployment scenarios:</li>
<li>Best-case scenario: Accessing accurate power matrices to calculate energy consumption per container</li>
<li>Current public cloud scenario: Using pretrained power models to estimate energy consumption per VM or container</li>
<li>Future infrastructure perspective: Cloud providers using Kepler to expose energy consumption metrics accurately and efficiently</li>
<li>Limitations of power models: They may not cover everything, especially offline workloads, and there is a need for transparent reporting and understanding of the underlying power estimation methods.</li>
<li>Idle power: Two definitions - constant idle power (machine energy consumption without considering load) and dynamic idle power (increasing energy consumption due to load).</li>
<li>Kepler uses different regression algorithms to create more accurate power models.</li>
<li>Earth ML Perth benchmark tool is used for analyzing machine learning workloads and comparing performance across different systems.</li>
<li>Deploying Kepler using Helm, which is a popular package manager for Kubernetes.</li>
<li>Consolidating workloads on energy-efficient nodes to improve overall efficiency.</li>
<li>Changing CPU frequency to optimize power consumption based on the workload.</li>
<li>Using different visualization tools like Grafana for monitoring and analyzing energy consumption in real-time.</li>

<li>Morris Eckert, architect at agile system startup in Bochum, Germany, talks about confidential computing</li>
<li>Confidential computing is focused on securing data by protecting it in memory and in use, beyond encryption</li>
<li>Hardware feature called trusted execution environment (TEE) allows isolating code and data from the rest of the system</li>
<li>Intel SGX was the first implementation of TEE, but it has performance overhead due to its small context</li>
<li>Next-generation implementations like AMD Secure Processor (ASP) or Intel TDX provide better interface for running applications</li>
<li>Confidential computing is important in cloud environments, especially for infrastructure security and multiparty scenarios</li>
<li>Infrastructure security: protect shared resources and third-party services from unauthorized access</li>
<li>Multiparty scenario: implement privacy-preserving AI solutions that protect the model owner's IP</li>
<li>Supply chain security: ensure trust in software and hardware components</li>
<li>Challenges for confidential computing include orchestration, performance, and compatibility with existing systems</li>
<li>Confidential Computing is gaining traction in highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare.</li>
<li>Three approaches to implementing confidential computing: SGX-based solution, confidential VMs, and Constellation project</li>
<li>SGX-based solution: process-based isolation using Intel SGX</li>
<li>Confidential VM: entire virtual machine is isolated, including the control plane</li>
<li>Constellation project: isolating infrastructure from the cloud service provider</li>
<li>Performance overhead is a concern with confidential computing, but it can be mitigated through hardware optimizations.</li>

<ul>
<li>Jonathan Berkhahn from IBM discussing minimalistic best practices in Kubernetes Operators</li>
<li>Operator is a complex topic, but can be summarized as replicating exact workflows in Kubernetes using custom resource definitions (CRDs) and controller implementations</li>
<li>CRD specifies API for user interaction to create new resources, while controller implements the logic to make things happen in the cluster</li>
<li>Operator SDK is a helpful tool for generating operator scaffolding</li>
<li>Keep it simple by avoiding unnecessary complexity and following best practices like using filters and event predicates to reduce traffic and improve performance</li>
<li>Minimize API load on controllers and ensure good citizenship in the cluster</li>
<li>Watch out for security vulnerabilities and be aware of container image size and complexity</li>
<li>Namespace scope operator is a good option for managing multiple clusters or namespaces, but consider scalability implications</li>
<li>Testing operators is important, and tools like Scorecard can help with integration testing</li>
<li>Use filters to manage resources in specific namespaces, and be aware of the impact on reconciliation loops and resource usage</li>
<li>Be mindful of custom resource dependencies and the impact on controller design</li>
<li>Avoid annotation-based configuration and use the declarative style of Kubernetes instead.</li>

<ul>
<li>Asier Gutierrez from Huawei talks about container security and IMA (Integrity Measurement Architecture) in Linux</li>
<li>IMA is a Linux security module that ensures file immutability by comparing hashes of files upon opening</li>
<li>It uses LSM (Linux Security Module) hooks to check whether the hash of a file matches the previous session's hash</li>
<li>IMA works along with TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip for added security</li>
<li>TPM is a cryptographic chip that can generate keys, perform remote attestation, and maintain a chain of trust</li>
<li>The speaker mentions IBM engineers who created an IMA namespace-based solution for container security called LKN</li>
<li>The new approach uses virtual PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers) inside containers to emulate real hardware PCRs</li>
<li>The activation of the IMA namespaces is linked to the username space number, providing an advantage over a shared key ring</li>
<li>The speaker explains how the IMA measurement list works and how it identifies containers using cpcrs and TPM chip</li>
<li>He also talks about the importance of maintaining trust in containers and preventing unauthorized access to the root file system or host</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that running containers in a cloud environment requires changes to the control plane, API server, container runc, and interface.</li>
<li>The IMA namespaces are created by the user space kernel when creating a container, with the regular flow continuing after that.</li>
<li>The speaker talks about some challenges, such as the need for a change in the API, the lack of specification of a username space in certain cases, and the issue of non-overlapping policies.</li>
<li>He also mentions that using external storage like NFS can pose issues with IMA due to its stateless nature and the inability to provide extended attributes for IMA hashes.</li>
<li>The speaker encourages collaboration and contribution to the kernel community to improve container security.</li>

<li>The speaker, Jasmine, is a machine learning engineer and open source project member of Alexio, an open source distributed data caching system.</li>
<li>Alexio started as a UC Berkeley research project in 2014 and has grown to have over 11,000 contributors and 13,000 community members.</li>
<li>It's used by companies like Meta and Uber for serving AI data platforms and improving performance.</li>
<li>In the era of large language model training with vast amounts of data, data readiness is crucial for high scalability, availability, and performance.</li>
<li>Data access patterns can vary greatly based on the type and size of files, leading to different performance-oriented caching strategies.</li>
<li>For example, large structured files like Arrow files may have sequential risk and benefit from position reads, while many small semistructured or unstructured files may have evenly distributed read access.</li>
<li>The recommended strategy depends on the traffic pattern, which can be either performance-oriented (computer-like) or capacity-oriented (cloud-friendly).</li>
<li>Performance-oriented strategies prioritize low latency and high throughput, while capacity-optimized strategies focus on large file sizes and reducing API calls.</li>
<li>One performance-optimized strategy is to preload data instead of loading it from public storage each time, which can reduce request rates and replication issues.</li>
<li>Another strategy is to optimize position read rates by reading larger chunks of data at once or using local caching for smaller files.</li>
<li>Alexio provides a distributed caching layer that helps fetch data quickly from cloud storage, serving as a unified caching layer for machine learning infrastructure in hybrid multicloud environments.</li>
<li>In such environments, the training platform and serving cluster can be separated with a middle storage system to optimize performance and reduce network congestion.</li>
<li>By integrating cache into AI training platforms, data access latency can be significantly reduced, improving overall performance and reducing costs.</li>
<li>Evaluating different read strategies, such as position reads versus streaming reads, can lead to better performance depending on the specific dataset and use case.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mark Sági-Kazár from Cisco's Innovation Lab discusses the story behind working on container registries</li>
<li>Initially, he wanted to validate an idea of deploying a container image in a partner environment with minimal operational burden</li>
<li>He looked into using cloud hosting solutions like Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry but found them less flexible for authorization</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer registries were another option, but they didn't fit his specific use case</li>
<li>He chose Cloud Rusty Registries due to its ease of setup and lower operational cost</li>
<li>However, he encountered challenges like managing robot accounts, group-based access, and API integrations</li>
<li>As the project grew, new requirements emerged, such as subscribing to software through a self-serve portal and onboarding customers</li>
<li>He eventually decided to build something similar to Harbor but with external authorization options</li>
<li>OCI distribution specification doesn't include an authentication solution, so he had to implement it separately using token-based authorization</li>
<li>The authorization service communicates with the registry to grant or deny access based on the presented token.</li>

<ul>
<li>Crossplane is a project that allows managing infrastructure using Kubernetes and native API.</li>
<li>It manages anything from AWS buckets to GitHub projects, exposes external APIs as Kubernetes resources, and provides real-time updates.</li>
<li>Crossplane uses Composition Functions to create complex infrastructure, such as managing an EKS cluster with IAM roles, OIDC clusters, node groups, etc.</li>
<li>Crossplane's Composition function simplifies the process of creating and managing complex infrastructure by exploding the entire set into smaller pieces, like EKS clusters with IM roles, OIDC clusters, node groups, etc.</li>
<li>Composition functions use patch transforms to modify desired states and support selector references for security groups and VPCs.</li>
<li>Crossplane's goal is to enable users to write simple functions using a Unix pipeline-like approach and run them as part of a multistep pipeline.</li>
<li>Crossplane functions are run in the background and do not restore state, making them stateless.</li>
<li>Crossplane functions are written in Go and use the kubernetes API machinery to apply changes. They accept input in the form of YAML or JSON, mutate it using JQ, and send the result back as a CR.</li>
<li>Functions can be installed and run imperatively, with automatic creation of required Kubernetes resources like services, secrets, and certificates.</li>
<li>Crossplane's composition pipeline is similar to CI systems like GitHub Actions, enabling users to define pipelines using YAML files and reference functions by name.</li>
<li>Functions can optionally accept input and use go templates to render text as part of the input.</li>
<li>Crossplane provides an SDK for easily writing functions, which includes handling conversion of protobuf messages to JSON and managing dependencies.</li>
<li>Crossplane runs functions using gRPC over HTTP and supports mutual TLS authentication.</li>
<li>Crossplane's design focuses on scalability, with the goal of being able to handle large organizations with massive amounts of resources.</li>
<li>The Crossplane team is actively adding features every quarter, with a focus on improving the core engine, reducing opinionatedness, and providing multistep pipelines and dependency management.</li>

<li>Gerlof Langeveld is a senior trainer at AT Computing, which provides Open Source training in Linux and related technologies. He also maintains the atop performance monitor.</li>
<li>The topic of the session is Linux memory management in relation to containers.</li>
<li>Memory management in Linux includes static part (kernel and ROM) and dynamic data created via slab cache.</li>
<li>Containers simplify resource allocation and guarantee memory usage for processes through cgroups.</li>
<li>Memory can be used in various ways, such as page cache, shared memory, and tempFS.</li>
<li>Swapping is a mechanism to free up memory when it gets full, but it can lead to performance issues.</li>
<li>The session includes a demonstration using the mem exerciser program and atop tool.</li>
<li>Physical memory is subdivided into nodes, with each node having its own threshold values for free pages.</li>
<li>Kernel decides which pages to swap based on swappiness parameter and available swap space.</li>
<li>Ohmscore is a value calculated by the kernel to prioritize processes for killing when memory gets full.</li>
<li>Containers can be managed using cgroups, which allow limiting resource usage for each container.</li>

<li>Daniel Cortazar and Yehui Wang discussed building SaaS services using CHAOSS technology for evaluating community health in open source projects.</li>
<li>CHAOS is an acronym for Community Health Analytics Open Source Silver Project, which aims to provide metrics for the health of open source communities.</li>
<li>The concept of open source community health was introduced with a focus on user care, collaboration, diversity, inclusion, risk, and productivity.</li>
<li>The CHAOSS project started around four years ago and has released over 30 metrics and the Matrix model to define health metrics in a technological agnostic way.</li>
<li>The goal is to produce open source software and bring together industrial partners, universities, individual contributors, and open source foundations to collaborate on defining community health metrics.</li>
<li>CHAOSS uses a Matrix model to measure open source health, focusing on productivity, robustness, and niche creation.</li>
<li>The ecosystem evaluation system is a theoretical framework provided by CHAOSS that combines metric and matrix models to evaluate open source communities.</li>
<li>Currently, there are four matrices in use: collaboration development index, community service support, organization activity, and community activity.</li>
<li>The homepage of OSS Compass provides access to the SAS platform and an OS ecosystem evaluation system.</li>
<li>CHAOSS aims to help organizations understand their community's health by providing detailed metric results for single repositories and comprehensive community-level monitoring.</li>

<li>Darcy Clarke, independent, discussing the future of JavaScript package management</li>
<li>Current state:</li>
<li>Large number of dependencies in a project, many transitive dependencies which can lead to security vulnerabilities and performance issues</li>
<li>Npm is the largest package registry with over 25 million packages and 210 billion downloads per month</li>
<li>Dependency resolution and versioning can be complex and inconsistent across package managers</li>
<li>Interoperability between different package managers can be limited</li>
<li>Problems:</li>
<li>Supply chain attacks and vulnerabilities in open source software are a concern</li>
<li>Managing dependencies and their updates takes significant time and effort, especially for smaller teams</li>
<li>The cost of maintaining open source packages is not fully understood or visible to consumers</li>
<li>Future state:</li>
<li>New tools like DSS dependency selector syntax and policy engines may provide more accurate and standardized dependency resolution</li>
<li>Open source ecosystems need to focus on security and sustainability</li>
<li>Collaboration and community building are important for improving the overall quality of the JavaScript package ecosystem.</li>

<ul>
<li>Rufaida Mugalli from Liquid Reply spoke about cost visibility for infrastructure using Infracost tool</li>
<li>Infracost is a tool that scans Terraform code and provides cost estimation for infrastructure</li>
<li>It integrates with different CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI</li>
<li>To use it, you need to install the Infracost CLI, retrieve an API key, and configure it in your GitHub action or CI/CD tool</li>
<li>Infracost works by scanning a Terraform plan and applying cost estimates based on the resources used</li>
<li>It can help prevent unexpected costs and make informed decisions about infrastructure choices</li>
<li>In the demo, Mugalli showed how to create an Infracost action using a container action in GitHub Actions, and how it can be integrated with a Jenkins pipeline.</li>
<li>Mugalli mentioned that Infracost supports multiple directories for different services and environments, and that it can break down costs by service or resource.</li>
<li>She also discussed the importance of understanding Terraform and using Infracost together for effective cost management.</li>
<li>Mugalli encouraged the audience to try out Infracost and provided resources for learning more about it.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mary Wang, Director of Open Source Ecosystem at Volvo Car Corporation, and Nithya Ruff, Senior Manager for Open Source Program Office (OSPO) at Amazon, discussed their experiences with OSPOs and engineering effectiveness in two different companies.</li>
<li>Volvo Car Corporation has a complicated background in open source, starting from the invention of the three-point safety belt which was not a commercial product but saved lives by being open sourced.</li>
<li>Open source is now a focus on safety, sustainability, and new technology at Volvo. The OSPO helps manage risk, compliance, and makes developer life easier.</li>
<li>Amazon's approach to open source is driven by its history of using open source infrastructure and services, supporting customers who want to use the platform and open source development, and being a good global citizen by building upon open source.</li>
<li>Amazon's OSPO removes barriers to using open source projects in their development process by automatically verifying license acceptance during build and release processes.</li>
<li>Volvo has also started an OSPO with 80,000 developers, who need help scaling due to the large number of products and distribution challenges. They also have champions dedicated to each product division who help with compliance and training.</li>
<li>Open source compliance is important for both companies, and they depend on the community for engagement and education. They also prioritize automating compliance processes where possible.</li>
<li>Developers spend a significant amount of time on administrative tasks instead of innovation, and open source champions can help reduce friction and make development more efficient.</li>
<li>Open source champions are dedicated experts who build relationships with upstream communities, ensure compatibility with internal code, and provide training and support for their teams.</li>
<li>Companies need to justify spending time and resources on open source initiatives by focusing on the value of contributions, reducing risk, and improving innovation.</li>
<li>The Linux Foundation has done an assessment of the cost of maintaining the Linux kernel which is worth the technical debt perspective.</li>
<li>Spdx version 30 RC is expected to get soon, it will hopefully integrate license compliance part and security compliance part in AI data unit.</li>
<li>Developers need to be aware of vulnerability reports and SBOM alignment across different teams requirements within development process CI CD.</li>
<li>The interesting part is the challenge of generating Boom information with standard like company define data and put it, and fulfilling license compliance and security compliance totally is needed.</li>

<ul>
<li>Patrick von Platen discusses his experience creating open-source machine learning libraries, specifically Transformers and Diffuser</li>
<li>He challenges the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in software design, focusing on machine learning libraries</li>
<li>The DRY principle states that every piece of knowledge in a system should have a single unambiguous authoritative representation</li>
<li>In machine learning, the fast-evolving nature of the field makes it challenging to define clear and unambiguous abstractions</li>
<li>Open source software, especially in machine learning, relies heavily on community contributions</li>
<li>The DRY principle can be difficult for new contributors to follow due to the large amount of existing code and the ambiguity of some abstractions</li>
<li>Transformers, a popular machine learning library, has a stable number of commits per week and relies on trusting contributors not to break core components</li>
<li>Transformers follows a "single model file policy" where every model knowledge is in one code file for ease of reading and understanding</li>
<li>Enforcing unified APIs across models is important for user experience, especially in production use cases</li>
<li>Avoiding unnecessary abstraction layers and copy-pasting code are also important considerations when designing machine learning libraries.</li>

<ul>
<li>Conrad Gawda, Orange Polska Cloud evangelist, Python developer trainer, and podcast host</li>
<li>Quantum computers are like analog calculators with the advantage of being able to represent an infinite number of states unlike analog computers</li>
<li>Ancestor of quantum computing was the differential analyzer created by Lord Kelvin in the 19th century</li>
<li>Leonardo Torres Quevedo, a Spanish engineer and inventor, also worked on early forms of electronic and analog computers</li>
<li>The difference between classical and quantum computing:</li>
<li>Classical computing uses bits with distinct states (0 or 1)</li>
<li>Quantum computing uses qubits which can exist in multiple states at once (superposition)</li>
<li>Qubits store and manipulate information using probability, not definite values</li>
<li>Measuring a qubit collapses its superposition, making it impossible to measure multiple qubits at once without destroying the superposition of the others</li>
<li>Quantum computers can perform complex calculations much faster than classical computers due to their ability to process many possibilities simultaneously</li>
<li>Entanglement is a physical phenomenon in quantum mechanics that allows quantum systems to be correlated in such a way that the state of one system cannot be described independently of the other</li>
<li>Quantum gates are used to manipulate qubits and perform operations on them, similar to classical logic gates but with different properties</li>
<li>Quantum circuits can be expressed as matrices and can reflect their code behavior, making them interchangeable with matrix representations</li>
<li>Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides access to quantum computing resources for simulation and experimentation.</li>
<li>To use AWS quantum services, an AWS account is required, along with the installation of certain libraries and tools.</li>
<li>Simulating a quantum circuit using AWS simulator can yield statistical results that show probability amplitudes for different states measured over multiple runs.</li>
<li>Running the same circuit on real quantum hardware will yield actual outputs with potential errors due to qubit noise and other physical limitations.</li>
<li>The future of quantum computing may involve larger, more error-corrected qubits, breaking encryption, optimizing problem solving, and even contributing to artificial intelligence.</li>

<ul>
<li>Tamsil Amani, software engineer at browserstack, discussing advancements in browser automation testing</li>
<li>Browser automation testing faced common problems like tests passing on one browser but failing on others and handling real-time events</li>
<li>History of browser automation testing: Web came in 1993, Selenium project started in 2006 with a different approach called WebDriver</li>
<li>WebDriver uses a protocol to communicate with the browser, either WebDriver classic or Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)</li>
<li>High-level approach tools like Cypress, TestCafe, and Puppeteer use APIs and Node.js, while low-level approach tools like WebDriver RPM and Night Watch use WebDriver classic protocol</li>
<li>Problem: browser doesn't trust JavaScript code from automation tools for complex tasks like opening new tabs, windows, or testing within iframes</li>
<li>Solution: low-level approach using remote commands and direct event handling in the browser</li>
<li>Event Loop in browsers allows for event handling, and trusted events have a property called "trusted" set to true if generated by user action, false otherwise</li>
<li>Previous example showed Selenium navigating a website and clicking an add cart button using WebDriver classic protocol</li>
<li>Disadvantages of WebDriver classic: not event-driven, limited cross-browser support relies on browser vendor implementation, and low scalability</li>
<li>Advantages of CDP: event-driven bidirectional messaging using websockets, provides low-level control for developers, and designed specifically for chromium-based browsers</li>
<li>WebDriver Die project merges single protocol for better cross-browser support and collaboration between browser vendors and open source automation projects</li>
<li>Demonstration of WebDriver die navigating a locally hosted page, raising a JavaScript exception, and catching it using the log inspector module in real time</li>
<li>Network interception allows testing without actual network requests, but requires mocked responses for irrelevant tests</li>
<li>Accessibility testing is important, and WebDriver Die includes accessibility APIs and support for screen readers and alternative text</li>
<li>WebDriver Die's roadmap includes implementing Network interception and improving developer experience by making it easier to use.</li>

<li>Introduction to SaaS Bill of Materials (SBOMs) by Rose Judge and Ivana Atanasova, open source engineers at VMware</li>
<li>SBOMs are used for securing software supply chains, especially in the context of cloud-based services</li>
<li>SBOMs describe components of a service, including dependencies, licenses, and version numbers</li>
<li>SBOMs help build trust between consumers and providers by providing transparency around software components</li>
<li>SBOMs can contain security information, such as vulnerabilities and compliance details</li>
<li>The US government is requiring vendors to provide SBOMs as part of Executive Order 14028</li>
<li>SBOMs are important for understanding the risks associated with the third-party services used in applications</li>
<li>SBOMs help organizations manage risk around vulnerable components and comply with security policies</li>
<li>Challenges with SBOMs include gathering information, ensuring correct formatting, and keeping up-to-date</li>
<li>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is working on standards for SBOMs, such as the SPDX format and the SAS Profile specification.</li>
<li>The SAS Profile complements the SPDX standard by providing additional contextual information about services.</li>
<li>The SAS bomb standard is focused on describing software components in a service, including service endpoints and data flows.</li>
<li>SBOMs can be used to track transitive dependencies and regulatory compliance requirements.</li>
<li>The working group for SBOMs meets every Monday morning to discuss progress and prepare advisories.</li>
<li>Questions from the audience included how to handle dynamic services with frequent changes, the role of observability tools in SBOM production, and the potential benefits of open source solutions for managing SBOMs.</li>

<li>Jose Carlos Chavez: software engineer, open source enthusiast, and father</li>
<li>Traditional Web Application Firewall (WAFF) protects web applications from known attacks like cross-site scripting, SQL injection, etc.</li>
<li>WAFF is deployed as a reverse proxy at the front server, analyzes traffic, and decides whether to allow or block requests based on rules.</li>
<li>Old WAFF features: IP fencing, Geo blocking, request response inspection, anomaly scoring, and block/allow certain number of requests per window time.</li>
<li>Traditional Perimeter Security is not effective in modern cloud-native environments due to scalability needs, microservices, and dynamic nature of traffic.</li>

<li>Marco Ippolito from NearForm discusses the OWASP Top 10 security vulnerabilities in Node.js</li>
<li>Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit organization that provides ranking of top 10 critical web application security risks based on expert surveys and common vulnerabilities</li>
<li>The Top 10 list includes server side request forgery, security logging monitoring failure, software data integrity failure, interconnected system vulnerability, authentication failure, insecure design, injection, cryptographic failure, broken access control, and vulnerable components</li>
<li>Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF): an attacker can manipulate a web application to make unintended HTTP requests on behalf of the client</li>
<li>Security logging monitoring failure: lack of security logging or proper alerting can allow attackers to go undetected for long periods of time</li>
<li>Software data integrity failure: malicious code can be injected into software through insecure CI/CD pipelines or deserialization vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Interconnected system vulnerability: unsecured access to one part of a system can lead to compromise of the entire system</li>
<li>Authentication failure: lack of proper authentication checks and weak passwords can make it easy for attackers to impersonate users</li>
<li>Insecure design: applications that don't consider security in their design can leave many vulnerabilities open to attackers</li>
<li>Cryptographic failure: using outdated or weak cryptographic algorithms can make it easier for attackers to gain access to sensitive information</li>
<li>Broken access control: improperly implemented access controls can allow unauthorized access to resources and data</li>
<li>Vulnerable components: using outdated or insecure third-party dependencies can leave applications open to attacks</li>
<li>To mitigate these vulnerabilities, developers should always validate user input, log everything, ensure data integrity through signing and hashing, use multifactor authentication, enforce strong passwords, keep software up-to-date, and follow best practices for access control.</li>

<li>Indik Gandarias has been working in the Innovation Technology Surveillance Department of the Basque Government since 2016.</li>
<li>Ichi is an online tool promoted by the Basque government to promote the use of the Basque language and solve translation problems between Basque, English, French, and Spanish.</li>
<li>The tool uses AI models trained on public and government data to perform text-to-speech operations and translations.</li>
<li>The system is designed for high demand services and can handle over 400,000 requests per hour, with nearly 300,000 distinct IP addresses making requests.</li>
<li>The service runs on a Kubernetes cluster to ensure resilient services and uses Fluentd for collecting logs and building dashboards to monitor service information.</li>
<li>To make it easier for developers to read application logs and send data, a custom Fluentd image was created with a JavaScript program script that installs easily and is familiar to developers.</li>
<li>The configuration file sets the path to the log file, rotates log files, and runs the Fluentd script to read logs and send data.</li>
<li>The service uses error handling mechanisms like alerting on specific conditions and using Microsoft Teams for notifications.</li>
<li>Synthetic tests are used to test APIs and websites and send notifications when errors occur.</li>
<li>Shadow deployment is used to deploy multiple versions of a service in parallel for testing and rolling back if necessary.</li>
<li>Canary deployment is used to gradually roll out new releases and monitor performance.</li>
<li>To avoid duplicating files, customized directory structures are used and common objects are defined in separate configuration files.</li>
<li>Jenkins is used to automatically deploy new versions of applications and test them using Podman and JMeter scripts.</li>
<li>When deploying multiple versions of a video service, the stable version is deployed first and the release candidate version is deployed using Jenkins for testing. The virtual service configuration is then changed to distribute traffic and replicate traffic from the release candidate version. Once the release candidate version is performing well, it can be gradually replaced with the stable version using a canary deployment.</li>
<li>To improve performance, the load balancer can be configured to balance traffic and use TLS security mode. The architecture should also be designed with basic AR architecture principles in mind.</li>
<li>The system uses rolling updates to deploy new versions of applications while minimizing downtime and using stealth mode for added security.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mike Wessell, executive director of Linux Foundation's Confidential Computing Consortium, discussing trust and confidential computing in the context of secure supply chain</li>
<li>Trust is a fundamental concept that is often taken for granted, especially when it comes to technology systems</li>
<li>Three types of trust:<ul>
<li>Contextual trust: trust in a computer system depends on its context (e.g., IO context, authentication context)</li>
<li>Time-dependent trust: trust may decay or grow based on expectations and entities involved</li>
<li>Symmetrical trust: trust relationship between two systems may not be mutual (e.g., a doctor performing CPR doesn't necessarily trust the patient back)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The question of "I Trust You" is a big one in the context of confidential computing</li>
<li>Confidential Computing refers to protecting data and code during execution, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality</li>
<li>A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a CPU-created set of memory pages that encrypts workload and protects it from the host OS and hypervisor</li>
<li>Attestation is a cryptographic process that allows making decisions based on trust</li>
<li>Protecting keys during operations like signing is crucial to maintain security</li>
<li>Complexity arises when considering chaining trust relationships, transitive trust, and distributive trust</li>
<li>The open-source community relies on best efforts for security, but it's essential to understand the limitations and challenges</li>
<li>Confidential Computing plays a role in securing supply chain management by protecting data and code at runtime</li>
<li>The hardware level is crucial for confidential computing, as the TCB (Trusted Computing Base) includes both software and hardware components</li>
<li>Trust Hardware is an important aspect of confidential computing, ensuring the correctness and security of hardware components</li>
<li>It's essential to keep separate trusted execution environments, each controlled by a different entity or group of entities</li>
<li>Monitoring and debugging are crucial for maintaining trust in a system, especially when dealing with complex systems like HSMs (Hardware Security Modules)</li>
<li>The tooling industry plays a vital role in solving the problem of confidential computing but also introduces challenges related to visibility and expertise.</li>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfRhDLbxstk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfRhDLbxstk</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Hannes Reinecke, SUSE Labs: 20-year Linux veteran, involved in storage research</li>
<li>Discussed the idea of using larger page sizes (block I/O) in Linux for improved efficiency and cost savings</li>
<li>Current Linux page size is typically 4kB due to CPU architecture and driver subsystem limitations</li>
<li>Large databases could benefit from larger page sizes as they are organized internally and hardware could move larger pages efficiently</li>
<li>Larger blocks would reduce overhead, but increase latency and require more memory for page cache</li>
<li>Folio structure proposed by Matthew Wilcox allows for transferring larger blocks without converting page cache folios</li>
<li>Buffer hat is a data structure used to manage I/O operations and could be replaced with the folio structure</li>
<li>The use of large pages has been discussed since the early days of Linux, but the mainframe concept of variable block size drives inspired the idea</li>
<li>Hardware-assisted memory management allows for determining whether given memory areas are dirty (need to be read from disk)</li>
<li>Folios are a common structure used in page management and could be used to identify large blocks</li>
<li>The buffer hat structure, which has been used since the early days of Linux, could be replaced with folios to transfer larger blocks efficiently</li>
<li>Modern interfaces like IO map already support folios, eliminating the need for intermediate structures</li>
<li>Converting the file system to use folios instead of buffer hats would require proper documentation and careful consideration of memory management implications.</li>

<ul>
<li>Eduardo Bonet, Brazilian, six years at GitLab, explaining why DevOps solutions fall short in the Machine Learning world</li>
<li>Two main issues: lack of understanding between people involved and fundamental differences between developing software and machine learning</li>
<li>Example 1: Uzi Hadoop Orchestra pipeline orchestrator failed to meet data scientist needs</li>
<li>Example 2: Resistance from data scientists to use tooling that brings software engineering practices into their workflow</li>
<li>MLOps: similar goal as DevOps but different technology, culture, and process for creating software with a Machine Learning feature</li>
<li>Data Scientists have different backgrounds and incentives than Software Engineers</li>
<li>Data Scientists' workflow is different: they need production data for model development and testing</li>
<li>Resistance to tooling, still using Jupyter Notebooks, and reluctance to install new tools or learn new languages</li>
<li>Need for explicit logic and code review in machine learning development</li>
<li>Extracting patterns from data is expensive and time-consuming in machine learning development</li>
<li>Different testing approaches, need for synthetic data, and versioning of models</li>
<li>Vision for GitLab MLOps: single application with a cohesive user interface, unified data store, and improved collaboration between data scientists and software engineers.</li>

<ul>
<li>Daniel Breger, security researcher at Palo Alto Networks, talks about Java file dependencies</li>
<li>Motivation: analyzing Java dependencies is important for understanding class loading and managing third-party libraries</li>
<li>Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs Java code by first compiling it into bytecode and then running it within the JVM</li>
<li>Third-party dependency management tools like Maven and osgi help manage Java projects and their dependencies</li>
<li>Maven uses a pom.xml file to define dependencies with Group ID, Artifact ID, and Version numbers</li>
<li>Transitive dependencies can cause issues when multiple versions of the same dependency conflict</li>
<li>osgi framework is another modular Java program that solves the problem of monolithic programs and their dependencies</li>
<li>osgi uses a Manifest file to include dependencies and define the main class and class path</li>
<li>Class loading in Java 9 introduces new concepts like module system and module path for better security and reducing Java platform size.</li>
<li>Understanding dependency management is crucial for secure software development, especially in large projects or organizations.</li>

<ul>
<li>Adrian Gonzalez-Martin from Selden Technologies Ltd spoke about securing machine learning workloads using the example of pickle, Python's native serialization format.</li>
<li>Pickle is widely used in machine learning, including popular frameworks like Jupyter Notebook and Keras.</li>
<li>Poisoning pickle files can be a security risk as they can execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.</li>
<li>MLSACUPS, an intersection of standard devops and machine learning security policies (DevSecOps), is important in securing AI systems.</li>
<li>Top 10 vulnerabilities in machine learning systems include supply chain risks, and pickle files are vulnerable to incompatibility issues between Python versions.</li>
<li>To mitigate the risk of pickle poisoning, alternatives like Onyx, a modeling descriptive format, can be used instead of pickling code directly.</li>
<li>Other security measures include using secure package managers, signing artifacts, and implementing multi-factor authentication for access to model serving environments.</li>
<li>The talk covered a demo of easy poisoning of a pickle file, the importance of supply chain security, and the use of tools like Scopes and Onyx to mitigate risks.</li>

<ul>
<li>Jérôme Petazzoni is talking about improving container image registry availability using Cube Image Keeper</li>
<li>Registries, such as Docker Hub and Quay, can have issues causing delays or even deletion of images</li>
<li>These issues include network problems, pull quotas, and the need to remove old images that are no longer in use</li>
<li>Alternatives for improving registry availability include using a mirror registry and setting up a local cache</li>
<li>Cube Image Keeper is a solution for automatically managing image caching and removing old images</li>
<li>It uses a DaemonSet to run on every node in the cluster, creating a proxy that rewrites image references to use the local cache instead of pulling from the registry</li>
<li>The controller runs in the background and checks for new images, creating an entry in etcd when one is detected</li>
<li>Cached images are kept for 30 days and can be forced to be refreshed by adding a specific annotation to the image</li>
<li>High availability can be enabled by using MinIO as a backend object store and enabling cache replication</li>
<li>The presentation includes live demonstrations of deploying and scaling a Kubernetes cluster, creating a demo image, and using Cube Image Keeper to cache it locally.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mohak Chadha is a PhD candidate discussing FedLess, a secure and scalable serverless Federated Learning system.</li>
<li>Traditional IT infrastructure evolution: physical servers, virtual machines (VMS), containerization, AWS Lambda introduction in 2014 as functional service platform.</li>
<li>Serverless Computing platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Function, Azure Function, IBM Cloud Function, and open-source alternatives offer event-driven, ephemeral stateless containers for function instances and automatic scaling.</li>
<li>Cold start process: when a new function instance is created, it goes through bootstrapping and runtime execution to handle an event and return a response.</li>
<li>Federated Learning (FL) involves collaborative learning between devices without sharing data, contrasting traditional cloud-centric deep learning approaches that require centralized processing of training data.</li>
<li>Two types of FL: cross-device participating clients (mostly mobile Edge devices with limited compute capability) and cross-Silo organized clients (institutions with sufficient compute capability).</li>
<li>Challenges in Federated Learning include scalability, handling heterogeneous hardware, and resource provisioning, leading to the need for a serverless Federated Learning system.</li>
<li>FedLess is a research project that aims to address these challenges by offering security, flexibility, and ease of use with modular design and support for multiple FL training strategies like FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold.</li>
<li>System architecture components include client (serverless function), controller (managing monitoring and strategy management), parameter server, accuracy trade-off model, and security features.</li>
<li>The project uses a Corpus system entirely written in Python 3 with TensorFlow and Keras for performance optimization.</li>
<li>FedLess addresses the straggler problem by implementing a Federal Scan strategy called Fella (Federated semi-asynchronous clustering based strategy) to adapt client behavior dynamically.</li>
<li>The experimental results show that FedLess outperforms traditional Federated Learning systems in terms of training time, cost, and convergence speed.</li>

<li>Spin lock is a locking mechanism used in user space to ensure only one thread accesses a critical section at a time.</li>
<li>Spin locks are preferred over other locking mechanisms like mutexes and semaphores for short critical sections as they avoid the overhead of context switching and kernel interaction.</li>
<li>Spin locks work by having threads spin (repeat a loop) instead of sleeping and waiting for the lock to be released.</li>
<li>The main problem with spin locks is that if the critical section is long, threads will waste CPU cycles spinning instead of doing useful work.</li>
<li>To address this issue, there are different ways to implement spin locks efficiently such as using CAS (Compare-and-Swap) instructions and restartable sequences.</li>
<li>Restartable sequences allow a thread to atomically measure if the critical section is available before entering it, reducing unnecessary spinning.</li>
<li>Spin locks can be implemented in user space without needing kernel assistance by using atomic operations and managing lock state.</li>
<li>The Linux kernel provides a user-space API called RTLM_SLEEPOK that implements efficient per-CPU operation without lock, which is an alternative to spin locks for long critical sections.</li>
<li>Spin locks are useful when dealing with short critical sections where thread contention is high and context switching overhead is significant.</li>
<li>There have been improvements in reading CPU ID using RTLM_SAC instead of the traditional getcpu() function, resulting in better performance in some benchmarks.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker discusses how container scheduling in a cluster can be optimized using logic derived from classic games Jenga and Tetris.</li>
<li>Container scheduler is responsible for finding the optimal node to run a container based on resource availability and other predefined parameters.</li>
<li>The scheduler uses a two-step process: first, it figures out which nodes fit the existing containers' resource requirements; then, it scores each node based on several parameters and chooses the one with the highest score.</li>
<li>Jenga analogy: A row in Tetris represents a node cluster's available capacity and utilized capacity, with incoming blocks being containers needing to be scheduled. The goal is to minimize gaps and pack nodes densely. However, resource decrease can lead to optimization difficulties, similar to playing Tetris when the game becomes increasingly challenging.</li>
<li>High-level resource allocation in a cluster considers various resources like CPU and memory. Factors such as lesser scheduling optimization and less effort are considered for densely packing the system.</li>
<li>In a real-world example with three nodes and six containers, a scheduler might fail to place container C4 because it requires more resources than what is currently available in the cluster. Autoscaling might add another node, but this adds cost without optimizing placement logically. The scheduler could generate a recommendation to move or reschedule containers.</li>
<li>Clusters like Kubernetes can use underlying APIs and constructs like node pod affinity and multiple migration strategies to solve this problem recursively by swapping larger containers with smaller ones or removing multiple smaller containers to fit a bigger one.</li>
<li>Swapping imbalanced nodes causing application performance degradation is crucial, as it keeps the balance between nodes and applications, allowing them to handle sudden extreme bursts of load traffic without degradation.</li>
<li>Jenga analogy: A node represents a block in Jenga, with containers being the turn of the game. Removing blocks that contribute least to overall balance is crucial for entire Jenga building stability.</li>
<li>Swapping containers causing imbalance can be identified using mathematical constructs like entropy. Swapping regularly or periodically based on entropy value can help optimize resource usage in a cluster.</li>
<li>In a real-world example, swapping CPU and memory-intensive applications between nodes C1 and C3 can improve overall system performance and reduce costs significantly by reducing auto scaling.</li>
<li>Implementation details of the optimization techniques discussed can be found on GitHub.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speakers are from National Chang Kong University in Taiwan and will be discussing a lightweight WiFi access solution for virtual machines (VMs) through a project called BFI.</li>
<li>They introduce themselves and explain the need for lightweight WiFi access in situations like continuous integration and easy deployment of virtualized environments.</li>
<li>The traditional wireless interface usually requires a complex software stack, but Virtual WiFi (VFI) offers a lighter solution with a smaller software stack.</li>
<li>VFI doesn't implement a21 protocol or offer full L2 protocol support but provides a Wireless interface device backend for the VM.</li>
<li>When running in a horse (VM) environment, VFI provides a wireless version of the driver and works like a CFG l211 driver with some differences.</li>
<li>The data path for VFI is simpler compared to traditional WiFi interfaces, as it doesn't need to encapsulate ethernet frames into L2 11 frames and can transmit ethernet frames directly.</li>
<li>In the management path, VFI uses a lightweight management path feature and delegates management to the CFG l21 driver for less resource usage.</li>
<li>The data path and management path work differently depending on whether VFI is running in a VM or a host (HSE) environment.</li>
<li>They also discuss how VFI maintains a table of Mac addresses within BSS and checks them when receiving frames to determine whether to drop them.</li>
<li>Future work for BFI includes supporting multi-queue RX IO, reducing lock contention, increasing throughput by allocating dedicated pages for reception, and saving time by not needing to allocate memory for receive frames.</li>

<ul>
<li>Marcelo Rao from IBM Research Tokyo presents a talk on measuring energy consumption in application clouds</li>
<li>Motivation: climate change and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially in the context of growing data transfer and computation power</li>
<li>Kepler is an open source project for measuring energy consumption at the container, pod, and job level in Kubernetes</li>
<li>Kepler uses a power model to estimate energy consumption based on real-time parametrics, such as CPU time and network throughput, collected using BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)</li>
<li>Power models are available for bare metal nodes and VMs, with support for different architectures like x86 and s390x</li>
<li>Kepler can also be used to measure power consumption per process and per GPU, with the ability to partition GPUs for different processes</li>
<li>Different scenarios for energy measurement: accurate access to power matrices (best), pretrained power models in public clouds (current), and future requirements for accurate measurements from cloud providers.</li>
<li>Idle power is a consideration in energy efficiency, with different approaches for dividing idle power across VMs or using green gas protocols.</li>
<li>Earth ML Perth benchmark tool is used to analyze machine learning workloads and compare performance across different GPUs and runtimes.</li>
<li>Kepler can be deployed using Helm or manually, and exposes metrics for energy consumption at the container level.</li>
<li>Users are aware of energy consumption through tools like Grafana dashboards, and can change parameters to optimize for energy efficiency.</li>
<li>Different backends (e.g., Torque, TensorFlow Onyx) can be used with Kepler depending on the workload.</li>
<li>Testing workloads for performance and energy consumption is important, and different runtimes may perform differently.</li>
<li>Kepler exports energy consumption data in a format similar to Prometheus, and allows developers to check occurrences of different metrics using various regression algorithms.</li>
<li>Future directions include improving the accuracy of power models, integrating with scheduling systems like Kappa and Capper, and providing more visualizations for energy consumption analysis.</li>

<ul>
<li>Jonathan Leitschuh, senior software security researcher at Project Alpha Omega and Dan Kaminsky Fellow, discusses eliminating open source security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Started with a simple vulnerability: using HTTP instead of HTTPS to resolve dependencies in build files</li>
<li>Attacker can hijack CI pipelines or machine running locally</li>
<li>Impacted major organizations like Spring, Apache Software Foundation, Red Hat, and Jenkins</li>
<li>Created the Fern Initiative to push for decommissioning support for HTTP in artifact servers and encourage use of HTTPS instead</li>
<li>Despite blog post announcing deprecation of HTTP, many still using it</li>
<li>Used CodeQL, a code analysis tool, to find vulnerable projects by querying GitHub</li>
<li>Found over 1500 critical vulnerabilities across open source ecosystem</li>
<li>Developed a Python-based wrapper for GitHub's Hub CLI to automate the process of generating and submitting pull requests for these fixes</li>
<li>Discussed three types of vulnerabilities he tackled: temporary directory hijacking, partial path reversal, and zip slip</li>
<li>For temporary directory hijacking, attacker can create a file in a shared temporary directory with the same name as one in a different user's directory, and the second user will see the attacker's file instead of their own</li>
<li>For partial path reversal, an attacker can access sibling directories by reversing the order of a prefix in a file system path</li>
<li>For zip slip, an attacker can create a malicious zip file with a key/path that tricks the victim into extracting it to a directory outside the original destination.</li>
<li>To fix these vulnerabilities, he used open rewrite to manipulate abstract syntax trees and keep formatting intact while making targeted changes</li>
<li>Encouraged using automated transformations to scale security research across open source projects.</li>
